1
00:01:38,993 --> 00:01:40,544
We're ruined!

2
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:42,320
No more free Wi-Fi.

3
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:44,756
Hey, Ki-jung!

4
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:45,924
Yeah?

5
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:50,095
The woman upstairs
finally put a password on iptime.

6
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:51,930
A password?

7
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:53,664
Did you try "123456789"?

8
00:01:53,808 --> 00:01:54,808
Yeah, doesn't work.

9
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,309
Try it in reverse.

10
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,811
I told you, it doesn't work.

11
00:01:57,912 --> 00:02:02,148
Shit! Then no text,
no Ka- Talk, no nothing?

12
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:03,424
That's right.

13
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:06,219
Hey, Kim Ki-taek.

14
00:02:06,754 --> 00:02:10,223
Fucking don't pretend to sleep.
What do you think?

15
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:16,813
Our phones are all shut off...
Wi-Fi is all shut off...

16
00:02:17,348 --> 00:02:20,441
Fucking what's your plan?
Huh?

17
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:23,962
- Hey, Ki-woo.
- Yes, father?

18
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:27,990
For Wi-Fi, you have to hold it up high.

19
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,204
Search out every corner.

20
00:02:36,742 --> 00:02:40,795
Damn stink bugs!

21
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,523
Hey, here! I got it!

22
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:44,941
Really? You got it?

23
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:46,860
Yeah, you're getting it too?

24
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:49,612
This one, 'coffee land 2G.'

25
00:02:49,713 --> 00:02:51,698
A new cafe opened up nearby?

26
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:53,408
Why can't I get it?

27
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,118
Come up here closer.

28
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,519
Hey kids?

29
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,913
- Is it working?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:01,566
Then check on Ka-Talk.

31
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:04,443
Pizza Time said they'd contact me.

32
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:06,362
Ok, hold on.

33
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:09,240
Here it is. Pizza Time.

34
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:16,014
Wow, check this out!

35
00:03:16,115 --> 00:03:19,309
At this speed, I think
we can finish all these today!

36
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,643
We're getting paid today, right?

37
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:24,213
- She does it standing.
- She's a pro!

38
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:27,341
What's that? Fumigation?

39
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:30,487
They still do that kind of thing?

40
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:31,529
Guess so.

41
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,405
Shut the window.

42
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:34,991
Leave it alone.
We'll get free indoor fumigation.

43
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:36,784
And get rid of the stink bugs.

44
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:39,770
Right, too many stink bugs these days.

45
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:44,191
Oh, that smell!

46
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:48,463
I told you to shut it!

47
00:03:48,564 --> 00:03:50,656
Should I shut it?

48
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:03,294
What's the problem exactly?

49
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,148
For example, have a look here.

50
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:09,592
You see this god-awful line?

51
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:11,986
And why is there a crease here? Huh?

52
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:13,738
Why is this sticking out?

53
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:16,432
That means you didn't finish folding it.

54
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:21,246
On inspection, 1 out of 4 were in this condition.

55
00:04:21,347 --> 00:04:23,898
Roughly, 1 out of 4 are rejects.

56
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:30,947
So, you're really docking 10% off our pay?

57
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:34,951
Considering the fail rate,
the penalty is very minor, don't you think?

58
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,080
But, our pay is so low already!
Aren't you being too harsh?

59
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:42,116
You look here.

60
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:45,019
This is not a minor issue.

61
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,548
Do you know how much damage
these faulty boxes cause to our brand image?

62
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:53,812
Brand? You don't even have
a proper box folder, shit!

63
00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:55,055
What did you say?!

64
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,440
Boss.

65
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,659
This is all because of that guy, isn't it?

66
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,618
What are you talking about?

67
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:04,581
That other part-time help,
he went AWOL, right?

68
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:07,792
Just when you got that huge, important
group order from that church.

69
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:11,028
How do you know these details?

70
00:05:11,188 --> 00:05:12,755
Who told you?

71
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:14,841
My sister knows the guy.

72
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:19,470
He's always been a bit strange.
He has a bad reputation around here.

73
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:21,664
Therefore, Boss.

74
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,225
The 10% penalty,
we'll accept it.

75
00:05:24,326 --> 00:05:25,310
In return...

76
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:26,752
In return?

77
00:05:26,912 --> 00:05:29,397
Any thought of hiring
new part-time help?

78
00:05:29,498 --> 00:05:32,883
Sis, we need more hired help!

79
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,846
Fire that other part-timer.
Hand him the termination penalty.

80
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:40,998
I'll come for the formal interview tomorrow.
What time works best best for you?

81
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:42,393
Hold on a minute.

82
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:45,271
I need to think about this.

83
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:49,773
Then, let's start with the
payment for these boxes.

84
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,079
So we've all gathered here today...

85
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:02,722
to celebrate the partial
reconnection of our phones

86
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:06,643
and the bountiful Wi-Fi!

87
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:10,296
That bastard !
So early in the evening!

88
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:14,525
Why haven't you put up the
'No Urinating' sign?

89
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:15,276
I told you to!

90
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:19,764
No, a sign like that only encourages
them...those drunkards.

91
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:22,075
At least yell at him!

92
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:23,809
No, don't shout.

93
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:26,062
"Please don't piss!"
Fuck!

94
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:30,691
Huh?
Is that Min-hyuk oppa?

95
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:33,294
Mister, what are you doing?
That's not the toilet.

96
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:34,712
That is Min-hyuk.

97
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:36,881
Hey, punk!

98
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:40,201
What... what are you staring at?

99
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,871
Come over here, you little shit.

100
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:47,958
Get a fucking grip!

101
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:51,020
Your friend has spunk!

102
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:54,190
University students have
real spirit. Spirit!

103
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,233
Unlike you, big brother.

104
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:58,736
But, is he coming here?
Were you expecting him?

105
00:06:58,837 --> 00:06:59,937
No.

106
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:01,072
Hello!

107
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:02,807
Min-hyuk, you've come!

108
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,950
Hey, what's up?

109
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:04,826
Have you been well, sir?

110
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:07,620
- Of course.
- Hey, what's the ocassion?

111
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:09,313
I texted you.
You didn't see it?

112
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:10,915
So sorry... during your meal.

113
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:12,211
No, no, we weren't eating.

114
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:14,585
- You've been well, Ki-jung?
- Yeah, and you?

115
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:17,422
You should've asked to meet up.
Why come all the way here?

116
00:07:17,523 --> 00:07:18,256
Because of this.

117
00:07:18,357 --> 00:07:21,217
This is for you,
but it's so darn heavy.

118
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:23,619
Really? Put it down here.

119
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:27,265
Wow, what is this?

120
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:28,933
I told my grandfather that
I'm seeing Ki-woo

121
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:32,294
and he insisted that
I take this to him.

122
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:39,009
Wow, is this an artscape stone?

123
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,988
You can also
call this a zen stone.

124
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:43,781
Wow, you know!

125
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:47,910
My grandpa has collected these stones
since his military academy days.

126
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:51,539
Now downstairs, upstairs,
living room, the study...

127
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,624
they're all filled with these.

128
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:57,587
This stone is said to bring material fortune
and promotion to the family...

129
00:07:57,688 --> 00:07:59,029
Hey, Min-hyuk!

130
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:02,300
This is really symbolic!

131
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:05,720
For sure! Truly, this is very timely.

132
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:06,512
Isn't it?

133
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:10,666
Please relay our deepest
gratitude to your grandfather.

134
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:12,960
You could've brought
something to eat.

135
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:25,907
Hey, what was that called?
Artscape stone?

136
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:27,325
You collect those rocks too?

137
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:33,392
Hey, thanks to that rock, I got to
see your parents. They looked healthy.

138
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:37,692
They're plenty healthy,
just out of work.

139
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:43,178
Is Ki-jung also home bound these days?
Not taking classes?

140
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:47,462
It's not that she doesn't want to.
It's that she can't.

141
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:56,587
She's cute, huh?

142
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:59,774
Wow, is that her?
The one you're tutoring?

143
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,318
Park Da-hye.
High school sophomore.

144
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:05,804
Why don't you take my place
as her English tutor?

145
00:09:06,073 --> 00:09:07,073
What are you talking about?

146
00:09:07,174 --> 00:09:09,683
It's tutoring for a rich family.
They pay very well.

147
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:11,828
And, she's a good kid.

148
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:15,314
While I'm studying abroad,
take good care of her.

149
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:19,210
What about your close
university friends?

150
00:09:19,311 --> 00:09:22,905
Why ask a deadbeat like me?

151
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,782
Why do you think?

152
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:27,426
Even the thought of it makes me sick.

153
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:31,681
My wolf-like bastard classmates
fawning all over Da-hye?

154
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:34,124
It's revolting.

155
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:41,131
You into her?

156
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:48,347
Hey, I'm serious.

157
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:53,769
Year after next, when she enters university,
I'm going to officially ask her out.

158
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,663
Until then, take good care of her.

159
00:09:55,764 --> 00:10:00,276
If it's you, I can leave with trust.

160
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:04,488
Thanks for trusting me, but...

161
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:08,450
do you want me to
pretend I'm a university student?

162
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:12,955
Ki-woo, think about it.

163
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,893
Two years before and after
your military service

164
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:19,312
you took the university entrance exam 4 times.

165
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:22,464
Grammar, vocabulary,
composition, conversation...

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,483
Honestly, when it comes to English

167
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:28,929
you can teach it 10 times better than those
alcohol binging college pricks.

168
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:33,058
- I guess so.
- Sure!

169
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:36,913
But, will that family accept me?
I'm not even a university student.

170
00:10:37,014 --> 00:10:38,539
We'll just BS a little.

171
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,776
It'll be alright! First of all,
you're going on my recommendation, and...

172
00:10:43,312 --> 00:10:46,488
how should I describe her mother...?

173
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:49,926
The madame's a bit simple.

174
00:10:50,027 --> 00:10:51,177
Young and simple.

175
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:52,411
Simple?

176
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:54,347
What do you mean?

177
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:58,709
I don't know... Anyway, all's good.
It's been good for me.

178
00:10:59,228 --> 00:11:00,228
So you're doing this, ok?

179
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:02,129
Ok, then.

180
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:07,068
Hey, I hear Ki-jung is very
talented with her hands.

181
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:11,364
...good with things like Photoshop.

182
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:15,576
With skills like this, why are you
rejected to art schools every time?

183
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:17,311
Wanna die?

184
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:21,624
Excuse me, it's non-smoking here.

185
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,125
Yeah, sure. Give me that.

186
00:11:23,226 --> 00:11:24,401
Ok.

187
00:11:28,732 --> 00:11:31,700
Now the finishing touch ...in scarlet red.

188
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:37,640
Wow, I wonder if Seoul National University
has a major in document forgery.

189
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:41,102
Ki-jung would be admitted
top of her class!

190
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:43,896
So true, huh?
Her skills!

191
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:49,510
Our boy's going for a job interview and
no words of encouragement?

192
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:51,145
Son!

193
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:55,057
I'm proud of you.

194
00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:56,275
Father!

195
00:11:57,177 --> 00:12:00,413
I don't think of this
as forgery or crime.

196
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:02,498
Because, for sure, I'm going to
this university next year.

197
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:06,085
So, you've got a plan!

198
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:10,364
I think of it as having produced
this document just earlier.

199
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:40,364
<b>Subtitle | www.movieddl.me</b>

200
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:46,817
Who is it?

201
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:49,170
Are you... Da-hye's mother?
How do you do?

202
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:51,047
I'm here on teacher
Min-hyuk's recommendation.

203
00:12:51,148 --> 00:12:53,282
Oh, right.
Come on in.

204
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:55,417
Thank you.

205
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,609
Hello!

206
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:30,753
How do you do, Madame?

207
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:34,281
I'm just someone who
works here. Come this way.

208
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:36,425
The garden is so nice.

209
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:38,160
The interior is nice, too.

210
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:41,980
You know the architect
Nam-goong? He's very famous.

211
00:13:42,081 --> 00:13:44,792
This is the house
that he lived in.

212
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:49,171
He built all this himself.

213
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:57,179
Now... as you can see,
this is just a family home with children.

214
00:13:57,714 --> 00:13:58,814
This way.

215
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:03,585
Please sit here and wait.
I'll bring her right up.

216
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:04,786
Yes.

217
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:24,576
Madame?

218
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:27,501
Madame?

219
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,465
He's here.
The tutoring candidate.

220
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:39,221
I don't need documents like these.

221
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:42,307
You're here on teacher Min-hyuk's
recommendation, anyway.

222
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:49,064
As you must know, teacher Min-hyuk
is such a "brilliant" person.

223
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,834
Da-hye and my satisfaction with teacher
Min-hyuk was very high.

224
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:55,171
...independent of her grades.
Do you know what I mean?

225
00:14:55,272 --> 00:14:56,372
Yes.

226
00:14:56,898 --> 00:14:58,549
Things were very good.

227
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:06,089
Honestly, Da-hye and I wanted to stick with him
until her university exam next year.

228
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:09,751
But, suddenly he tells us
he's leaving to study abroad.

229
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:17,401
So, excuse me for being blunt,
but... honestly

230
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:22,323
if you're not up to teacher
Min-hyuk's level, then...

231
00:15:22,424 --> 00:15:24,850
there's really no point.

232
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:30,623
So, anyway, what I wanted to say is...

233
00:15:30,724 --> 00:15:36,378
for your first lesson today,
would you mind if I sat in?

234
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:40,449
I want to see it "full time"
to see how you run your lessons.

235
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:44,578
Is it okay with you?

236
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:14,524
Are you sure about #24?

237
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:27,179
You just spent a long while solving those
problems before going back to #24.

238
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,955
Right?

239
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:31,833
Yes.

240
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:44,930
If this was the actual exam and this the first question,
you'd be screwed from the beginning.

241
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:49,101
Look at this. Your pulse is
pitter-pattering all over the place.

242
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:55,065
The heart cannot lie.

243
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:59,169
What is an exam, exactly?
It's all about cutting through.

244
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,114
The flow! Lose that rhythm
and you're finished.

245
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:04,633
The correct answer to #24?
I'm not interested.

246
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:10,122
How you punch through the entire exam...
How you dominate it

247
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,540
that's what I'm interested in.

248
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:17,295
In real battle, it's all about the spirit.

249
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:19,756
Spirit.

250
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:22,259
Understand?

251
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:36,081
Your salary will be paid out
about this time every month

252
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:39,359
Lessons every Mon/Wed/Fri.
2 hours each. Is that okay?

253
00:17:40,211 --> 00:17:41,211
As for the amount...

254
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:45,049
I was going to match teacher Min-hyuk's
rate but adjusted it for inflation.

255
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,700
Thank you.

256
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:50,220
How about a proper introduction?

257
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:53,248
Da-hye's English tutor.
We'll call him teacher Kevin.

258
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,625
Teacher Kevin!

259
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:59,521
If you get hungry during your lessons,
let me know anytime.

260
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:01,690
If you need anything, just ask her.

261
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,384
She's the house expert, more than me!
She knows every nook and cranny...

262
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:07,971
Da-song ! Watch the head!

263
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:09,782
I'm so sorry! He startled you?

264
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:12,326
So, cute. Da-song?

265
00:18:12,427 --> 00:18:14,244
Yes, our youngest.

266
00:18:14,345 --> 00:18:15,871
Da-song, come say hi!

267
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:17,689
This is teacher Kevin!

268
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:24,296
This is an Indian arrow.
We ordered it directly from a U.S. website.

269
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:27,699
He's been fanatic about
Indians since last year.

270
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:30,836
Indians?

271
00:18:31,404 --> 00:18:34,139
He seems to have mania traits.

272
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,810
Well, he's just so aloof
and easily distracted.

273
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:40,712
He can hardly sit still!

274
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:43,023
So, last year I enrolled him
in Cub Scouts...

275
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:46,068
hoping he'd learn some
restraint and focus.

276
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:47,677
But, look at him.

277
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:49,888
He came back worse!

278
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:57,562
Not sure if he was influenced by his
Cub Scout teacher who is crazy about Indians.

279
00:18:58,097 --> 00:19:02,292
The very spirit of Cub Scouts originates
from the native American Indians.

280
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:03,335
That's a good thing!

281
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:06,547
Teacher Kevin,
you were a Cub Scout, too?

282
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:09,842
Yes, I'm a total Scout
by disposition.

283
00:19:09,943 --> 00:19:14,329
Our Da-song is a total artist by
disposition. Have a look.

284
00:19:14,697 --> 00:19:18,142
This is really symbolic.
It's very intense!

285
00:19:18,243 --> 00:19:19,893
Intense, right?

286
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:22,295
Of course, you are very insightful.

287
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:24,898
That's a drawing of
a chimpanzee, right?

288
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:26,758
It's a self-portrait.

289
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:31,596
Sure enough!

290
00:19:32,632 --> 00:19:35,868
From the perspective of grown-ups
Da-song's expressive genius

291
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:38,412
eludes their understanding.

292
00:19:38,513 --> 00:19:43,959
Maybe that's why we've been through
so many art teachers.

293
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,319
And none of them could last
more than a month.

294
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:50,949
And also, Da-song is
so difficult to control.

295
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:55,954
- Madame?
- Yes?

296
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:59,875
Someone just came to mind.

297
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,918
What was her name?

298
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:04,938
Jessica! Right, Jessica...

299
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,342
Among the junior classmates of my cousin
is someone named Jessica.

300
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,029
What was her Korean name?

301
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:17,159
Anyway, after studying applied arts at the
Illinois State University

302
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,161
she just returned to Korea.

303
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:21,705
Illinois... and?

304
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:28,584
Jessica has a reputation for her unconventional
teaching style and command over children.

305
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,573
...a very fresh approach in this field.

306
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:34,301
But, even with her
unconventional methods...

307
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:36,678
Her students get in to the best art schools
- from middle school to university.

308
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:40,916
Oh my... I'm very curious.
What is she like?

309
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:43,043
Would you like to meet her?

310
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:46,463
But, I hear it's very hard
to get an appointment with her.

311
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:53,553
Hold it.

312
00:20:55,173 --> 00:20:58,659
Jessica, Only child, Illinois, Chicago

313
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,978
Senior classmate Kim Jin-mo,
Second cousin.

314
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,881
Look how he's stained the table cloth
with drippings of banchan, gochujang and rice

315
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:15,384
in this mosaic-like arrangement.

316
00:21:15,485 --> 00:21:18,178
These have repeating patterns, too.

317
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:21,557
Gochujang is red, grains of the rice.
Well, anyway...

318
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:26,670
He's showing his Basquiat-esque feel.
And he's only 9 year old!

319
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:28,772
Hmm... you've piqued my interest.

320
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:34,010
Since I'm sure teacher Jessica gets all this

321
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:38,181
I'll leave you two to continue
and I will start my lesson with Da-hye.

322
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,409
Teacher Jessica, see you next time.

323
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,477
Yes, thank you.

324
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:52,028
So if you see over there, shall we say...
Da-song's eccentric disposition?

325
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:55,665
Da-hye.

326
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:59,411
Shall we start with question #38?

327
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,975
Teacher.

328
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:06,293
Yeah?

329
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:11,673
Did you know that with
Da-song... it's all a pretense?

330
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,401
Huh? What do you mean?

331
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:16,194
It's all a show. A show!

332
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:20,032
Acting all genius, that 4th dimension
stuff - it's all a pretense.

333
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:21,766
An artist cosplay.

334
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:23,560
Da-song?

335
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:26,330
You know that thing...

336
00:22:26,485 --> 00:22:31,230
when someone stops in his tracks and looks up
as if stricken with some random inspiration?

337
00:22:31,352 --> 00:22:37,115
Like when someone stops to stare at the
clouds for 10 minutes... stuff like that?

338
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,301
You do know!

339
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:41,970
He gives me the goose bumps!

340
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:45,498
He pretends that everyday life
gets him down.

341
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:47,351
Makes me want to puke, really.

342
00:22:47,452 --> 00:22:50,628
So, Da-song is like that.

343
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:55,383
But, what's that got to do with
you solving those problems?

344
00:22:59,422 --> 00:23:03,099
I mean... well, I'm just saying.

345
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:07,604
Ok then, with that in mind...

346
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:13,026
What you just expressed about
Da-song was very interesting.

347
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:15,403
So, let's try some
English composition.

348
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:21,618
Only, be sure to use the word
"pretend" at least twice.

349
00:23:22,153 --> 00:23:25,097
Then, can I ask you a question?

350
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:26,264
Sure.

351
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:28,833
That teacher Jessica.

352
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:36,466
Is she really your cousin's junior classmate?

353
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:39,569
What do you mean?

354
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,055
She's your girlfriend, right?

355
00:23:45,093 --> 00:23:49,187
No, I met her today for the first time!

356
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:56,236
Teacher Jessica was
really pretty, wasn't she?

357
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:58,947
You don't find her attractive?

358
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:01,591
You saw her earlier?

359
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:06,096
Sure, she's pretty.
You can say she's attractive.

360
00:24:06,197 --> 00:24:07,297
Yeah.

361
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,710
I knew it!

362
00:24:13,246 --> 00:24:15,505
You are interested in her.

363
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:19,676
Da-hye...

364
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:28,535
If we had to use the rose metaphor
for teacher Jessica

365
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:30,186
then, Da-hye, you are...

366
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:17,626
- Let's solve the problem.
- Ok.

367
00:25:17,727 --> 00:25:23,090
Please understand that my boy
has trouble keeping still.

368
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:24,699
I understand.

369
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,334
Da-song!

370
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:28,095
Da-song, get up!

371
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:29,913
Come on, Da-song!

372
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:31,807
It's in your butt!

373
00:25:31,908 --> 00:25:34,810
- Mrs. Park, please leave us.
- What?

374
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:37,253
I never teach with parents in the room.

375
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:40,107
But today is our first day,
and as you can see, he's...

376
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:42,258
Please wait downstairs.

377
00:25:43,736 --> 00:25:44,736
Park Da-song?

378
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:46,054
Da-song!

379
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:51,518
- Madame?
- Huh?

380
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:53,870
Would you like some
plum vinegar drink?

381
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:54,955
Whah?

382
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:58,375
Mixed with some honey
...to ease your tension.

383
00:25:58,476 --> 00:26:00,902
Yeah, that would be great.

384
00:26:15,451 --> 00:26:17,210
- Over here!
- Yes?

385
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:18,854
We can do it this way.

386
00:26:18,955 --> 00:26:22,215
Mix two glasses and
take it up to Da-song's room.

387
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,485
You're not a parent,
so you can go in!

388
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:27,028
Oh, that's right!

389
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:29,990
Then I'll report back on
how they're doing in there...

390
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:32,809
I should've done this earlier!

391
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:36,176
What is it?

392
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:37,831
Are they out?

393
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:39,482
Yeah.

394
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,779
So, you're finished already?

395
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:47,615
Mrs. Park?

396
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,118
Please come and sit next to me.

397
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:53,788
Da-song, you wait upstairs.

398
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:56,925
Hurry it up!

399
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,442
Da-song just drew this.

400
00:27:05,543 --> 00:27:06,968
I see...

401
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:10,989
I want to speak with Mrs. Park alone.

402
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,240
Oh, but she's our...

403
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:15,310
No, please excuse us.

404
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:25,587
Mrs. Park, I told you earlier that I'm doing advanced
studies in art psychology and art therapy?

405
00:27:25,688 --> 00:27:26,863
Yes, yes.

406
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:30,408
Did something happen to
Da-song in the first grade?

407
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:35,413
To be honest,

408
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:38,934
before deciding whether
I can take on Da-song,

409
00:27:39,035 --> 00:27:41,794
I will need to know more about this.

410
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:45,907
But, so sudden to talk
about this right now...

411
00:27:46,008 --> 00:27:46,858
What to do?

412
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,634
It's alright, then.

413
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:54,115
Normally, the lower-right region of a drawing
is called the "schizophrenia zone."

414
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:56,701
Psychotic symptoms
often reveal themselves here.

415
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:57,702
Oh, phrenia...

416
00:27:57,803 --> 00:27:58,787
Look here.

417
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:01,456
Da-song drew these
unusual shapes, right?

418
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:02,774
I see.

419
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:07,671
Over there, it's the same!
It's the same, right?

420
00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:09,947
Yes, that's correct.

421
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:13,760
Similar shapes in the same zone.
Do you see it now?

422
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:15,119
Yes.

423
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:19,975
I saw that drawing every day
...at every meal.

424
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:22,227
But, I had absolutely no idea!

425
00:28:22,328 --> 00:28:25,463
Please calm down. Keep calm!

426
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:29,008
This is all a black box
into Da-song's mind.

427
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:33,304
Would you like to open that
black box with me, Mrs. Park?

428
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,573
I want to open it, teacher.

429
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:40,078
Then, Mon/Tue/Thus/Fri.
2-hour sessions every week.

430
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:44,416
And this is not your basic tutoring,
but more art therapy, right?

431
00:28:44,517 --> 00:28:45,375
Of course.

432
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:49,362
Therefore, my rate will need to be
considerably higher.

433
00:28:49,964 --> 00:28:50,964
Are you okay with that?

434
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:52,740
I'm more thankful for it!

435
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:55,993
Oh my, that must be Da-song's dad.

436
00:29:02,535 --> 00:29:06,712
Honey, Da-song's new art teacher is here.

437
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,551
Her name's teacher Jessica,
from Illinois.

438
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:14,095
Jessica ! This is Dong-ik.

439
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:16,031
- How do you do?
- Oh, hi.

440
00:29:16,132 --> 00:29:17,974
Please take good care of Da-song.

441
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:19,409
Is the lesson over?

442
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,610
Yes, just finished.

443
00:29:21,037 --> 00:29:22,037
- Driver Yoon.
- Yes?

444
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:23,705
- Are you ok with time?
- Yes, I'm ok.

445
00:29:23,806 --> 00:29:26,374
Why not give the teacher a lift home?

446
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:30,920
Sure, we don't want her walking down
alone at night, right?

447
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,280
Of course.

448
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,823
Teacher Jessica?

449
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:39,871
Since you're already in the car,
may I drive you all the way home?

450
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:43,266
- Which neighborhood?
- No. that's fine

451
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:47,170
You can just drop me off
at the Hyehwa station.

452
00:29:47,313 --> 00:29:48,313
Thank you.

453
00:29:48,414 --> 00:29:49,689
I don't mind if your home is far.

454
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,985
- My shift is finished, anyway.
- I'll just get off at the Hyehwa station.

455
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:57,513
...looks like it's going to rain.

456
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,284
Forget the subway, let's go all the way
in this Mercedes Benz.

457
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:04,854
I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend
at the Hyehwa station, exit #3.

458
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,490
I see.

459
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:46,270
Dad, did you drive a lot of Mercedes Benzes
when you worked as a designated driver?

460
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:53,152
Mercedes Benzes? Not then, but I did a lot
when I worked as a valet in Daechi-dong.

461
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,172
Oh right, you worked as a valet!

462
00:30:56,273 --> 00:31:00,009
After our fried chicken business went bust, and
before the opening of our Taiwanese castella bakery.

463
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,928
In that 6-month window?

464
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:05,831
No, it was after our
castella bakery went bust.

465
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:10,628
Then, we're moving ahead with it?

466
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:14,774
I finished setting up the
Mercedes Benz S-class already.

467
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,759
Then, we are moving ahead with it.

468
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:19,195
Wow, it's so symbolic here.

469
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,682
Look Father, we're eating in a
drivers' cafeteria, of all places.

470
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,476
Indeed, a drivers' cafeteria!

471
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,871
Eat as much as you want
there's plenty!

472
00:31:27,972 --> 00:31:30,898
Why are you being so generous?
Kids are the ones buying!

473
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:34,043
My son, have some more. Eat up!

474
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,961
Yes, sir.

475
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:36,087
Eat your fill!

476
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:38,423
What did you do to Mrs. Park yesterday?

477
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:39,174
What?

478
00:31:39,275 --> 00:31:40,967
She was freaking out!

479
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:43,411
Saying she was so moved and stuff.

480
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:44,888
Fuck, I don't know!

481
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:48,874
I researched art therapy
on the internet and BS'd a little.

482
00:31:48,993 --> 00:31:51,561
Suddenly, she started weeping!

483
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:54,046
Crazy bitch.
I couldn't believe it!

484
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:29,682
Oh, you're home, Honey?

485
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:31,500
Did you have dinner?

486
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:34,771
Why, is something wrong?

487
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:36,189
Is the housekeeper out?

488
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,341
She's walking the dogs.

489
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,343
Honey.

490
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:43,596
This was under my car seat.

491
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,351
Driver Yoon, you crazy bastard.

492
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,810
What is this?

493
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,080
I'm so sorry, honey.

494
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:54,290
I didn't know driver Yoon
was this kind of person.

495
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:57,485
Don't you pay him very well?

496
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,005
Is this bastard skimping
motel costs so he can save up?

497
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:02,548
He must be a pervert.

498
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:03,925
He likes it in the car
better than motels.

499
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:07,929
Oh, that's disgusting.
How in his own boss' car!

500
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:12,667
A young guy's sex life is his
private business. That's all fine.

501
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:18,714
But of all places,
why in my car?

502
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,778
And if so, why not in his own front seat?
Why cross the line like that?

503
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,429
You're right.

504
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,866
Does dripping his semen
all over my seat turn him on?

505
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:31,143
You're right.

506
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:39,860
But, you know what's
strangest of all?

507
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:41,737
What?

508
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:45,091
If you have car sex

509
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:50,471
one might leave behind
a strand of hair, or an earring.

510
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:51,681
Right.

511
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:55,626
But how can you forget
your own panties?

512
00:33:56,161 --> 00:34:00,047
So, true!
It's a hard thing to forget!

513
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:05,344
So, this raises suspicions
about this woman.

514
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,596
Are you getting this?

515
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:18,750
Oh my... like meth or cocaine?!

516
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:20,568
Shhh!
The kids...

517
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:22,295
What do we do?

518
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:25,048
What if anyone finds something
like white powder in your car?

519
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,742
Calm down, relax!

520
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:29,784
Relax.

521
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,621
For now it's just a supposition.
A reasonable suspicion.

522
00:34:34,158 --> 00:34:35,808
But, nothing to call the police about.

523
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,752
Of course, not.

524
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:44,108
Silly for a busy guy like me to reprimand,
"Why are you banging someone in my car?"

525
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,318
That would be silly.

526
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,235
So instead...

527
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:52,367
Can you make up some harmless excuse
and let him go quietly?

528
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:53,826
Okay, sure.

529
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:57,288
No need to mention panties or car sex.

530
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:59,374
We don't need to stoop
down to that level, do we?

531
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:01,484
Surely not!

532
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,879
But, do you think driver Yoon might go online
to accuse us of wrongful termination?

533
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,989
Give him a good severance package...

534
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:10,802
You're fininshed?
Did Da-song do well today?

535
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:12,995
Yes, of course.

536
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,640
- So, lesson is finished?
- Yes.

537
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,309
Teacher, the last time you came,

538
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,853
our driver gave you a ride, right?

539
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:21,813
That's right.

540
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:24,273
This may be an awkward question,

541
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:26,258
but nothing happened then?

542
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:27,735
He was very friendly.

543
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:29,696
I asked him to just drop
me off at the Hyehwa station.

544
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:33,074
But, he kept insisting to
take me all the way home.

545
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:36,327
That jerk, he drove all the way to
your home, so late at night?

546
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:38,104
To reveal where you live?

547
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,416
No, I got off at the Hyehwa station.

548
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:43,876
Oh, you did well.
You did very well.

549
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,545
Jessica, nice!

550
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:48,005
Did something happen with him?

551
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:53,302
He won't be working for us anymore.
A slightly shameful incident.

552
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:55,346
What kind of incident?

553
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:58,415
Teacher, enough about that.

554
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:03,563
But I'm surprised. He was
so gentlemanly and cool.

555
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:06,983
Jessica, you're
too young and innocent!

556
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:09,176
You haven't experienced
a lot of people.

557
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:14,782
But, at the time, we were excited
to have such a young, hip driver.

558
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:18,077
But aren't drivers
better when a bit older?

559
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:22,165
That's true! They drive better
and have better manners.

560
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:24,917
The driver who worked for my uncle
was just like that.

561
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:29,464
Driver Kim -- he was
so congenial and nice.

562
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:32,091
I used to call him 'uncle' too,
when I was young.

563
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:34,177
You know a man like that?

564
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:37,329
Yes, he was so mild-mannered.

565
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:42,626
Right! My uncle recently
transferred to Chicago.

566
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:45,897
I wonder if he's currently
available.

567
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:49,984
Very interesting !
Could I meet him, maybe?

568
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:51,152
Oh, really?

569
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:53,637
Nowadays, I can't trust people.

570
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:57,074
If not recommended by someone
I know well, I really can't trust anyone.

571
00:36:57,175 --> 00:37:01,854
But, if he's some one you've seen
since you were young, that's reassuring.

572
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,483
Do you really want to meet him?

573
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:08,527
I'm deadly serious.

574
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:12,615
Networking through
trusted referrals seems best.

575
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,366
How shall I describe it?

576
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:15,951
Safety belt of trust?

577
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,470
- This one's different.
- Here.

578
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:18,137
Oh, right.

579
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:19,872
And this one.

580
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,516
Looks like a touch screen now.

581
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:24,519
That's not touch.
It says you have to turn it.

582
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,670
Wow, this thing?

583
00:37:27,105 --> 00:37:28,105
Sir?

584
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:30,549
You're taking your time?

585
00:37:33,147 --> 00:37:34,976
This is a nice car.

586
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:39,141
Here it is!
Come over here.

587
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:44,396
He's in a meeting now.

588
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:51,445
Have a seat and wait here.

589
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:03,540
How do you do?
Nice to meet...

590
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:08,145
But, is it compatible
with mobile phones?

591
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:14,927
These are not compatible.
Requires more computing power.

592
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:20,683
This isn't a test drive or anything,
so don't be nervous.

593
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:24,478
I came out because I felt
so couped up at the office all day.

594
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:26,163
I understand.

595
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:30,859
Constant chatter, all that bother.
At least, the car should offer some peace.

596
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:34,571
Thank you.

597
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:36,799
You seem to know the roads very well?

598
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,219
Below the 38th parallel, I know
all the roads and side streets.

599
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,580
It comes naturally
after 30 years behind the wheel.

600
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,750
I respect those who work
in a single field for a long time.

601
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:49,979
Well, to be honest
this may be a simple vocation.

602
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,090
But, to get on the road every morning
with the head of a household

603
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:54,775
or with the company's
commander-in-chief

604
00:38:54,876 --> 00:39:00,389
or with just a solitary man
each and every morning...

605
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:03,017
it's a companionship of a sort.

606
00:39:03,176 --> 00:39:06,078
So, that's been my approach
each and every day.

607
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:08,063
The years sure pass quickly.

608
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:14,403
Sure enough,
your cornering is superb.

609
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:21,469
Well, the fundamentals
may look easy, but...

610
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:26,332
May look sheepish, but
inside she's a crafty old fox.

611
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,543
Sometimes she acts like
she owns the house!

612
00:39:30,062 --> 00:39:31,062
Right.

613
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:35,650
She's lived there longer
than anyone in that house.

614
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:39,403
She was the housekeeper
to that architect, Nam-goong.

615
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:44,183
But then, she stayed on
to work for this family.

616
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:46,077
When Mr. Nam-goong moved out,

617
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:49,080
he introduced that woman to
Mr. and Mrs. Park, telling them...

618
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:52,524
"She takes great care of this house.
You should keep her!"

619
00:39:52,642 --> 00:39:55,962
So, this is the case where the house ownership
changed, but not the housekeeper.

620
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:59,114
She's holding tight to this good job
and not letting go.

621
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:02,785
To surgically remove a woman like that,
we need some preparation.

622
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,830
Right, we need a plan.

623
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:11,418
I want some peaches.
I like peaches best.

624
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:13,062
Why not ask for some?

625
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:16,924
No peaches allowed in our home
- - forbidden fruit.

626
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:27,451
According to what
I heard from Da-hye,

627
00:40:27,552 --> 00:40:32,164
she has a massively
serious allergy to peaches.

628
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:35,501
You know all that
fuzz on the skin?

629
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:39,213
If she goes anywhere near it,
she breaks out in hives

630
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:43,283
has trouble breathing,
asthma, a total meltdown!

631
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:51,959
No, no, no. No peaches anywhere
and it still happened.

632
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,088
That's what I'm saying!

633
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:58,816
Usually when I get symptoms like this

634
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:02,319
I run to my room and
medication takes care of it.

635
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:07,783
This was so sudden, I panicked and
couldn't remember where I put it!

636
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:12,913
Madame, this woman behind me,
is that...?

637
00:41:13,014 --> 00:41:14,915
Oh, my! That's our housekeeper!

638
00:41:15,016 --> 00:41:17,668
Then it's true!
Oh, what should I do?

639
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:20,755
I wasn't sure if that was really her.

640
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:24,616
I've only seen her a couple of times
in the living room.

641
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,136
You took this in a hospital?

642
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:31,165
A few days ago,
I went for my annual checkup.

643
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:35,711
I took a selfie for my wife,
and there she was, right behind me.

644
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:38,213
She's talking to someone on the phone?

645
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:43,569
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop...

646
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,488
but because I could hear her conversation!

647
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:47,323
- I couldn't help but...
- Cut, cut!

648
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:50,284
Father, your emotion is
too far up to here.

649
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:52,644
Bring it down to about here.

650
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,623
I couldn't help but overhear.

651
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:58,484
Compress it, then... boom!

652
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,296
What I'm trying to say is,
it's just that...

653
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:06,617
her voice was quite loud!

654
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:10,304
It's alright.
Just tell me, okay?

655
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:13,224
She said she just got
diagnosed with Active TB.

656
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:15,392
And was shouting
about it on the phone

657
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:18,562
as if so upset with herself,
she could hardly control herself!

658
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:20,981
Tuberculosis? Surely...

659
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:26,428
It's true! She was telling someone
on the phone that she had Active TB.

660
00:42:26,963 --> 00:42:31,558
"Oh my! Do people still get TB these days?"
Oh my! Do people still get TB these days?

661
00:42:31,752 --> 00:42:32,852
"Dad : "

662
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:38,082
"True... in the old days, people
used to buy Christmas seals for this."

663
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:39,500
"Feels like something from a bygone era..."

664
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:41,252
Search it on the internet.

665
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:45,172
Korea ranks # 1 for TB
among of all OECD countries.

666
00:42:45,273 --> 00:42:48,801
"She was working, pretending
as if nothing was wrong !"

667
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:50,845
"With young children in the house
like Da-song."

668
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:54,223
And, with young children
in the house like Da-song.

669
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:57,560
A TB patient is doing dishes, preparing
food and coughing up bodily fluids...

670
00:42:57,661 --> 00:42:59,294
Stop it, please!

671
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:56,143
If we get the chance,
this will be the finishing touch.

672
00:44:41,556 --> 00:44:43,148
- Have a seat
- Yes.

673
00:44:45,293 --> 00:44:46,293
Driver Kim.

674
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:50,464
Please don't tell any of this
to my kids or my husband, okay?

675
00:44:50,565 --> 00:44:51,590
I understand.

676
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:56,370
If he hears I've harboured
a TB patient in our home

677
00:44:56,529 --> 00:44:59,265
I'll be hanged and quartered!

678
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:01,267
Don't worry, Madame.

679
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:04,979
And if I may please say one thing

680
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,382
I have no hard feelings
against that woman.

681
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:16,006
I merely felt I had to speak up from
the perspective of public health and safety.

682
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:19,910
This could be misconstrued
as snitching...

683
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:21,412
You don't have to worry about that.

684
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:24,081
I'm not going to mention TB to her.

685
00:45:24,182 --> 00:45:26,625
I'll just make up some other
excuse and dismiss her.

686
00:45:26,726 --> 00:45:28,235
Simply and quietly.

687
00:45:29,854 --> 00:45:32,548
It's the proven way.
This is the best way.

688
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:34,574
Well, then.

689
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:51,164
You...
washed your hands?

690
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:38,364
Driver Kim, do you know
a good braised-galbi place?

691
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:40,115
Not too far away.
Somewhere near by?

692
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:41,575
Sure.

693
00:46:41,676 --> 00:46:45,437
- Then you'll be eating out?
- That's right.

694
00:46:46,055 --> 00:46:48,982
Not sure why the craving
for braised-galbi today.

695
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:52,402
Our housekeeper used to make
really good braised ribs.

696
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:55,506
The one who quit
the day before yesterday?

697
00:46:55,607 --> 00:47:00,577
My wife wouldn't even tell me why she quit.

698
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:08,585
Then again, housekeepers are plentiful.
We could just hire a new one.

699
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:14,233
Still, it's a shame.
She was a very good housekeeper.

700
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:15,234
I see.

701
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:17,903
She kept every corner
of the house in great shape.

702
00:47:18,004 --> 00:47:20,680
And she knew
never to cross the line.

703
00:47:21,216 --> 00:47:24,100
I can't stand people
who cross the line.

704
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:27,312
If just one negative point...

705
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:29,415
eating too much?

706
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:32,442
She said she always ate two servings.

707
00:47:33,102 --> 00:47:36,964
Then again, she does do a lot of work.

708
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:42,428
Then she'd better find someone
quickly. A new housekeeper.

709
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:44,555
She's in big trouble right now.

710
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:49,125
With that housekeeper, our
house will be trashed in a week.

711
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:53,171
My clothes will start to reek...

712
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:57,109
My wife never had any talent for housework.

713
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,512
She's bad at cleaning,
and her cooking's god-awful.

714
00:48:01,548 --> 00:48:03,431
You still love her, right?

715
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:14,442
Of course, I love her.

716
00:48:15,478 --> 00:48:17,362
You have to call that love.

717
00:48:18,982 --> 00:48:21,157
Then, take this.

718
00:48:25,196 --> 00:48:27,389
THE CARE?
What is this?

719
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,975
I found out about them
just recently.

720
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:34,921
How to describe it?
It's a members-only service.

721
00:48:35,498 --> 00:48:42,029
Provides experienced maids, caregivers
and drivers like myself to VIP customers like you.

722
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:48,035
A professional service of carefully
selected experts in their fields.

723
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:51,354
You can tell they're very exclusive
even from the card.

724
00:48:51,889 --> 00:48:53,481
The design, too.

725
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,543
Driver Kim, how did you
come across this company?

726
00:48:56,644 --> 00:49:01,173
They contacted me, because
of my veteran-status as VIP driver.

727
00:49:01,274 --> 00:49:03,491
A kind of a scout offer?

728
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:10,766
But, when I got their call, I was already
scheduled to interview with you.

729
00:49:10,867 --> 00:49:14,044
I see...

730
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:18,745
Your grace for turning down work with such a
prestigious company to work for me...

731
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:20,300
I'm forever indebted.

732
00:49:21,836 --> 00:49:24,054
Fuck!

733
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:29,952
Anyway, I can give
this card to my wife, right?

734
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:31,828
Yes, that's why I brought it up.

735
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:34,105
No need to mention me.

736
00:49:35,516 --> 00:49:38,693
You can tell her that you
found the company yourself.

737
00:49:39,228 --> 00:49:40,587
Sure, why not.

738
00:49:40,688 --> 00:49:43,048
Thanks to you I can
play the good husband.

739
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:47,928
On the back, there's a
number for consultations.

740
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:49,179
Tell her to call that...

741
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,830
Eyes on the road!

742
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:59,089
Hello, this is The Care's
senior advisor, Yeo Myung-son.

743
00:49:59,248 --> 00:50:02,717
Yes, is this The Care's main office?

744
00:50:03,503 --> 00:50:06,905
She's going to be very successful,
even as a con artist.

745
00:50:07,006 --> 00:50:09,641
Isn't the tone of her voice great?
Takes after me.

746
00:50:11,177 --> 00:50:13,704
From what I've heard,
it's a members-only service?

747
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:17,666
So, you're not currently
a member, I assume?

748
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:20,294
That's right. What steps
do I need to take?

749
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:24,506
We will need just a few documents.

750
00:50:24,607 --> 00:50:27,593
Are you ready to write this down?

751
00:50:27,694 --> 00:50:32,580
Your family register,
copy of your family's ID cards...

752
00:50:33,282 --> 00:50:36,226
income documents to
verify your income level

753
00:50:36,327 --> 00:50:38,770
and the title of your property, etc.

754
00:50:38,871 --> 00:50:41,297
Our property title? Ah, yes.

755
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:51,158
Peaches!!

756
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:53,393
You have some too, teacher Kevin.

757
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:54,853
Thank you.

758
00:51:03,354 --> 00:51:06,381
Miss, just leave it outside from now.

759
00:51:06,482 --> 00:51:09,095
- Just knock.
- Yes.

760
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,126
Never enter during sessions!

761
00:51:13,127 --> 00:51:13,797
Yes.

762
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:17,809
Park Da-song!

763
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:19,144
It's daddy!

764
00:51:19,245 --> 00:51:20,712
Where are you?

765
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:26,276
Daddy!

766
00:51:26,377 --> 00:51:27,235
Son!

767
00:51:27,336 --> 00:51:30,238
Walkie talkies!

768
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:31,331
Walkie talkies!

769
00:51:31,432 --> 00:51:34,476
What do you like better,
me or the walkie talkies?

770
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:38,080
Da-song, what are you doing running out
during the middle of your lesson?

771
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:41,750
When did you buy all this?

772
00:51:41,851 --> 00:51:42,793
It's no big deal.

773
00:51:42,894 --> 00:51:43,994
Huh?

774
00:51:46,847 --> 00:51:48,078
Huh?

775
00:51:48,589 --> 00:51:50,295
What is it?

776
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,287
What are you doing?

777
00:51:55,123 --> 00:51:56,515
Da-song, that's enough!

778
00:51:56,616 --> 00:52:00,435
Huh? It's the same!
They smell the same!

779
00:52:00,536 --> 00:52:04,147
What nonsense! Go on up.
Teacher Jessica is waiting.

780
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:08,301
Teacher Jessica has a similar smell, too.

781
00:52:09,337 --> 00:52:12,656
Then, do each of us have to
use different soaps?

782
00:52:12,757 --> 00:52:16,618
Father, shouldn't we use
different laundry detergents, too?

783
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:17,828
And fabric softeners?

784
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:22,249
You mean, we run the laundry for each
person separately? Geez.

785
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:24,275
That's not it.

786
00:52:24,894 --> 00:52:27,112
The stench is coming from
our semi-basement.

787
00:52:28,147 --> 00:52:30,949
To lose the smell,
we have to leave this place.

788
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:38,598
Anyway, aren't we fortunate to be
worrying about something like this?

789
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:39,725
Sure!

790
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:42,936
These days, even an opening for
just one security guard

791
00:52:43,037 --> 00:52:47,733
draws over 500 four-year university
graduates flocking to get the job.

792
00:52:47,834 --> 00:52:51,094
And, our entire family
got hired full time!

793
00:52:51,629 --> 00:52:53,263
That's right, Father!

794
00:52:53,798 --> 00:52:56,241
Put all our 4 salaries together...

795
00:52:56,342 --> 00:53:00,687
amount of wealth that's transferred from their
household to our's every month is no joke!

796
00:53:01,264 --> 00:53:05,792
To the great Mr. Park,
let's offer a prayer of gratitude.

797
00:53:05,893 --> 00:53:07,002
And, to Min-hyuk!

798
00:53:07,103 --> 00:53:09,755
Because of Ki-woo's
amazing friend...

799
00:53:09,856 --> 00:53:14,159
Thanks to him... Oh, fuck!
Just when we're trying to have a drink!

800
00:53:18,723 --> 00:53:19,723
Oh, he's fuck'n dead!

801
00:53:19,824 --> 00:53:22,350
Whoa, Kim Ki-woo's got the spunk!

802
00:53:22,451 --> 00:53:25,128
You're over-doing it!

803
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:28,482
Here, use this instead.

804
00:53:31,848 --> 00:53:33,482
Damn you!

805
00:53:36,424 --> 00:53:37,657
Get a grip!

806
00:53:37,758 --> 00:53:39,684
A grip!

807
00:53:41,721 --> 00:53:43,479
Wow!

808
00:53:47,518 --> 00:53:49,944
Total innundation!

809
00:54:06,412 --> 00:54:10,190
Current weather is clear, over.
The clouds are moving in.

810
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:12,692
But they're not rain clouds, over.

811
00:54:12,793 --> 00:54:14,152
Copy, over.

812
00:54:14,253 --> 00:54:20,575
Currently your sister's lips are pouting like a duck's bill.

813
00:54:20,676 --> 00:54:23,662
She's super annoyed, over.

814
00:54:23,763 --> 00:54:28,500
Can't I just stay behind to study English?
Ask teacher Kevin to come over?

815
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:31,962
Hey! Just when we're about
to leave, why all the fuss?

816
00:54:32,063 --> 00:54:34,381
Since we all decided to go,
let's go in a good mood!

817
00:54:34,482 --> 00:54:37,133
Yeah, Da-hye. This is
no ordinary camping trip.

818
00:54:37,234 --> 00:54:37,968
That's right!

819
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:39,894
As his older sister, you think it's ok
to miss your brother's birthday?

820
00:54:39,995 --> 00:54:40,887
Absolutely, not!

821
00:54:40,988 --> 00:54:43,265
Even I have taken the time out
of my very busy schedule to go.

822
00:54:43,366 --> 00:54:46,292
Of course! If you don't go,
it'll be your loss.

823
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:50,772
Oh, right. You know the
beam projector?

824
00:54:50,873 --> 00:54:51,815
The projecting thing?

825
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:54,092
Right, prepare the
outdoor beam projector.

826
00:54:54,585 --> 00:54:59,072
And look for Da-song's
camping raincoat.

827
00:54:59,173 --> 00:55:01,099
He get's excited when it rains.

828
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:05,328
You remember now?
Zoonie, Berry, and Fofoo.

829
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:06,496
Zoonie and Berry get this.

830
00:55:06,597 --> 00:55:09,416
Yes, Natural Balance Original Ultra.

831
00:55:09,517 --> 00:55:11,985
Right, and for Foofoo...

832
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,712
Kani Kamaboko.
The Japanese crab sticks.

833
00:55:13,813 --> 00:55:14,838
Yes.

834
00:55:14,939 --> 00:55:17,882
When you walk Zoonie,
give him a long leash.

835
00:55:17,983 --> 00:55:20,343
He needs to run about in
all directions to feel satisfied.

836
00:55:20,444 --> 00:55:23,871
He's like the canine version of Da-song!

837
00:55:49,432 --> 00:55:51,207
Hey, son!

838
00:55:51,308 --> 00:55:54,336
What are you doing lying out there?

839
00:55:54,437 --> 00:55:57,321
Son of a gun.
Must be hot out.

840
00:55:57,857 --> 00:56:02,577
This is lying at home,
gazing at the sky.

841
00:56:04,113 --> 00:56:05,705
It's very nice.

842
00:56:09,243 --> 00:56:11,227
Mom, want some water?

843
00:56:11,328 --> 00:56:12,771
There's sparkling, right?

844
00:56:12,872 --> 00:56:15,357
Ki-jung, want a bottle of water?

845
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:17,592
Whoa, telepathy!
Thank you.

846
00:56:40,174 --> 00:56:43,048
Whoa, yeah!

847
00:56:43,204 --> 00:56:43,704
! crash ! <i>I</i>

848
00:56:43,808 --> 00:56:46,818
Wow, all these different kinds of liquor.

849
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:50,975
Father! I will pour you a special round.

850
00:56:51,076 --> 00:56:55,588
Wow, this is rather picturesque.

851
00:56:56,123 --> 00:57:01,277
The garden with the rain, shaaaa!
Us with the whiskey, shaaaa!

852
00:57:01,378 --> 00:57:06,099
But, son. What's that yellow notebook
you've been carrying around?

853
00:57:06,759 --> 00:57:10,203
This? It's Da-hye's diary.

854
00:57:10,304 --> 00:57:11,788
Diary?

855
00:57:11,889 --> 00:57:16,150
That's really disgusting.
Why are you reading her diary?

856
00:57:16,685 --> 00:57:21,965
So we can understand each other
more deeply - in a positive way.

857
00:57:22,066 --> 00:57:24,784
Fuck. You two dating?

858
00:57:24,944 --> 00:57:29,413
I'm serious!
She likes me a lot too.

859
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,792
A while back...

860
00:57:33,828 --> 00:57:35,086
Never mind.

861
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:39,023
When she enters university,
I intend to officially ask her out.

862
00:57:39,124 --> 00:57:40,508
Seriously.

863
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:47,140
Oh, my son!

864
00:57:47,299 --> 00:57:51,894
Then, this house will become
your in-laws' house?

865
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:59,210
Fuck, then I've been here
washing my in-laws' dishes?

866
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:03,645
Sure! Washing his father-in-law's underwear
and washing your daughter-in-law's socks!

867
00:58:14,535 --> 00:58:19,981
I think... she's alright.
She's well-behaved.

868
00:58:20,082 --> 00:58:24,385
Pretty-like, but
not spoiled rotten.

869
00:58:25,421 --> 00:58:29,599
Well, now that we're projecting...

870
00:58:30,676 --> 00:58:33,286
If Da-hye and I get married...

871
00:58:33,387 --> 00:58:37,231
Your roles can be
hired out to actors.

872
00:58:38,209 --> 00:58:39,209
She...

873
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:43,171
She did so many part-time gigs
at weddings last year.

874
00:58:43,272 --> 00:58:47,592
I even had to catch bouquets
from bitches I've never met.

875
00:58:47,693 --> 00:58:50,678
If you catch the bouquet,
they pay you extra $10.

876
00:58:50,779 --> 00:58:52,806
That's how your acting
improved so much!

877
00:58:52,907 --> 00:58:58,394
Acting is one thing, but
this family is so gullible, right?

878
00:58:58,495 --> 00:59:00,688
The madame, especially.

879
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:02,798
You said it.

880
00:59:04,335 --> 00:59:07,904
She's so naive,
and so nice!

881
00:59:08,005 --> 00:59:09,906
She's rich, but still nice.

882
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:12,367
It's not, "rich, but still nice."

883
00:59:12,468 --> 00:59:16,395
It's, "nice because she's rich!"
You know what I'm saying?

884
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:23,444
Hell, if I had all this money

885
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,383
I'd be even nicer!

886
00:59:28,484 --> 00:59:29,992
Nicer!

887
00:59:30,152 --> 00:59:32,470
That's true.
Your mom's right.

888
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:34,973
Rich people are naive.
Not tied up in knots all the time.

889
00:59:35,074 --> 00:59:37,350
Kids from rich families are bright
and happy... no wrinkles.

890
00:59:37,451 --> 00:59:40,854
It's the iron.
Money is the iron.

891
00:59:40,955 --> 00:59:43,356
Those wrinkles are
all smoothed out.

892
00:59:43,457 --> 00:59:45,007
Hey, Ki-woo.

893
00:59:45,626 --> 00:59:50,680
You know that driver Yoon?
His sir name was Yoon, right?

894
00:59:51,215 --> 00:59:53,449
The driver before me.

895
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:54,742
Yes, 'Yoon.'

896
00:59:54,843 --> 00:59:59,414
He must be working somewhere now,
right? ...having found a job?

897
00:59:59,515 --> 01:00:01,833
Sure, he must have.

898
01:00:01,934 --> 01:00:05,528
He's of younger age
and of good physique...

899
01:00:06,063 --> 01:00:09,132
Right, he must have
gone to a better employer.

900
01:00:09,233 --> 01:00:11,325
Fucking hell, come on!

901
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:14,345
What's with her?

902
01:00:14,446 --> 01:00:20,918
We're our biggest problem.
Let's just worry about us, okay?

903
01:00:21,036 --> 01:00:24,439
Dad ! Dad ! Dad!

904
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:28,860
Please give us some
focus, okay? Us!

905
01:00:28,961 --> 01:00:33,281
Not driver Yoon,
but to me, please!

906
01:00:33,382 --> 01:00:35,617
Killer timing, huh?

907
01:00:35,718 --> 01:00:39,812
Wow, Ki-jung goes, "Kyaaaa! !"
and the lightning goes, "Boooom ! !"

908
01:00:41,473 --> 01:00:44,567
Hey, Jessica.
Bottoms up!

909
01:00:45,602 --> 01:00:51,049
Hey, when I went up earlier,
and you were in the bath...

910
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:53,075
Bath. What about it?

911
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:57,013
How to put it?
You fit right in.

912
01:00:57,114 --> 01:00:59,749
This rich house atmosphere suits
you very well. You're not like us.

913
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:00,850
Fuck off.

914
01:01:00,951 --> 01:01:01,809
I'm serious!

915
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:03,561
Seriously, father.
Earlier...

916
01:01:03,662 --> 01:01:06,547
she was lying back in the tub
watching TV

917
01:01:07,082 --> 01:01:09,633
like she's lived here for years.

918
01:01:11,211 --> 01:01:17,158
Speaking of which,
if this house became our's

919
01:01:17,259 --> 01:01:21,496
assuming we lived here,
which room would you choose?

920
01:01:21,597 --> 01:01:26,793
I'm asking which room you like best in this
masterpeice of the great architect Nam-goong.

921
01:01:26,894 --> 01:01:28,753
Fuck, I don't know!

922
01:01:28,854 --> 01:01:32,656
First let me live here,
then I'll worry about it.

923
01:01:33,192 --> 01:01:35,326
We already live here, don't we?

924
01:01:35,861 --> 01:01:39,663
Drinking in the middle of the
living room like this.

925
01:01:39,782 --> 01:01:42,517
Right, this is 'living here.'
What's more to it?

926
01:01:42,618 --> 01:01:47,271
This is our home right now.
It's cosy.

927
01:01:47,372 --> 01:01:50,358
Are you cosy?
Are you feeling cosy?

928
01:01:50,459 --> 01:01:55,554
Sure, but suppose Mr. Park suddenly
walked through that door right now.

929
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:57,407
Kim Ki-taek, this human being...

930
01:01:57,508 --> 01:02:01,143
would scatter and hide like a cockroach.

931
01:02:01,678 --> 01:02:03,830
Kids, you know at our house when

932
01:02:03,931 --> 01:02:09,669
we turn on the fluorescent light at night,
how the cockroaches scatter and hide?

933
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,654
You know what I mean?

934
01:02:12,231 --> 01:02:15,574
Fucking getting tired of listening to this...

935
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:17,993
- What? A cockroach?
- Yeah!

936
01:02:21,532 --> 01:02:23,391
Huh? What are you doing?

937
01:02:23,492 --> 01:02:24,600
Really?

938
01:02:24,701 --> 01:02:28,712
Father, don't do it!
You're gonna kill somebody.

939
01:02:35,754 --> 01:02:37,447
What the hell!

940
01:02:37,548 --> 01:02:39,157
Fooled you.
Fooled you!

941
01:02:39,258 --> 01:02:40,575
Father, you're so...

942
01:02:40,676 --> 01:02:44,746
Ki-woo, you were fooled too!
Very real, wasn't it?

943
01:02:44,847 --> 01:02:48,541
If it was for real,
you'd be dead, you fucker!

944
01:02:48,642 --> 01:02:52,695
What the fuck?! Pet...?

945
01:02:58,235 --> 01:03:00,470
What the...
Who is it at this hour?

946
01:03:00,571 --> 01:03:02,455
Who is it?

947
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:09,729
Why, she...?

948
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:12,923
Fuck, that's that woman, isn't it?

949
01:03:13,458 --> 01:03:15,301
Why is she here?

950
01:03:15,836 --> 01:03:19,722
She keeps, keeps, keeps ringing.

951
01:03:20,757 --> 01:03:23,642
Causing a ruckus in the neighborhood.

952
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:25,620
Who is it?

953
01:03:25,721 --> 01:03:30,541
Oh, how do you do? I'm...

954
01:03:30,642 --> 01:03:32,251
Um... the madame's not in, right?

955
01:03:32,352 --> 01:03:33,252
What?

956
01:03:33,353 --> 01:03:37,948
I worked here
for a very long time.

957
01:03:38,483 --> 01:03:44,013
Above the monitor there,
you see the photo of 3 dogs, right?

958
01:03:44,114 --> 01:03:45,556
Zoonie, Berry, Foofoo.

959
01:03:45,657 --> 01:03:50,186
I get it, but what do you
want at this hour?

960
01:03:50,287 --> 01:03:54,924
You're the woman who came as
my successor. Am I right?

961
01:03:59,963 --> 01:04:01,722
Anyway...

962
01:04:02,257 --> 01:04:05,535
I'm very sorry
to call on you so late.

963
01:04:05,636 --> 01:04:07,520
It's just that...

964
01:04:08,055 --> 01:04:14,818
I left something of mine in the
kitchen basement. Unintentionally.

965
01:04:15,354 --> 01:04:21,742
When I quit, they pushed me out
so abruptly without proper notice.

966
01:04:24,821 --> 01:04:26,997
Could you open the door?

967
01:04:29,034 --> 01:04:31,126
What do we do?

968
01:04:31,662 --> 01:04:33,921
This wasn't in the plan.

969
01:04:41,463 --> 01:04:43,180
Please excuse me.

970
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:44,740
This way.

971
01:04:44,841 --> 01:04:46,475
Yes, thank you.

972
01:04:48,512 --> 01:04:50,454
Put your raincoat here...

973
01:04:50,555 --> 01:04:53,148
I'll be very quick and leaving.

974
01:04:53,725 --> 01:04:57,378
Oh, you did a lot of cooking there.
What a big mess to clean up!

975
01:04:57,479 --> 01:05:00,864
But, what is it that
you left behind below?

976
01:05:05,404 --> 01:05:07,997
Want to come down with me?

977
01:05:09,032 --> 01:05:12,376
Just be back quickly.

978
01:06:05,464 --> 01:06:08,807
Help me push this!

979
01:06:08,925 --> 01:06:11,410
Pull it! From over there!

980
01:06:11,511 --> 01:06:13,079
What?

981
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:14,280
Pull!

982
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,651
Harder!

983
01:06:22,189 --> 01:06:23,697
Are you alright?

984
01:06:25,233 --> 01:06:26,533
I startled you.

985
01:06:29,071 --> 01:06:30,621
Thank you ! Thank you!

986
01:06:31,698 --> 01:06:33,123
Thank you!

987
01:06:41,108 --> 01:06:42,108
Honey!

988
01:06:42,209 --> 01:06:43,342
What the hell?

989
01:06:44,878 --> 01:06:45,945
Hey, you!

990
01:06:46,046 --> 01:06:47,596
Honey!

991
01:06:48,632 --> 01:06:50,182
Honey!

992
01:06:52,577 --> 01:06:53,577
Lady!

993
01:06:53,678 --> 01:06:55,871
Honey, I'm here! Honey!

994
01:06:55,972 --> 01:06:57,272
What the?

995
01:07:01,186 --> 01:07:02,837
Honey, I'm fine.

996
01:07:02,938 --> 01:07:04,697
Of course you're not!

997
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:05,798
I'm fine, really.

998
01:07:05,899 --> 01:07:07,133
You are not fine!

999
01:07:07,234 --> 01:07:09,010
I'm so hungry.

1000
01:07:09,111 --> 01:07:10,011
Take this. Take this.

1001
01:07:10,112 --> 01:07:13,347
How many days have you gone hungry?

1002
01:07:13,448 --> 01:07:15,165
Honey, you've been so very hungry!

1003
01:07:17,202 --> 01:07:18,477
It's okay. It's okay.

1004
01:07:18,578 --> 01:07:21,272
She's a good woman.
I got in, thanks to her.

1005
01:07:21,373 --> 01:07:23,482
It was the iron plate.
Iron plate for grilling meats.

1006
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:25,026
It was wedged under the shelf.

1007
01:07:25,127 --> 01:07:26,193
No wonder.

1008
01:07:26,294 --> 01:07:29,697
Strangely, no matter how much I tried,
it wouldn't budge from the inside.

1009
01:07:29,798 --> 01:07:33,308
- What is this?
- I know you're freaked out.

1010
01:07:33,427 --> 01:07:36,019
I would be freaked out, too!

1011
01:07:36,138 --> 01:07:40,666
As fellow workers...
Right, sister Chung-sook?

1012
01:07:40,767 --> 01:07:43,610
How do you know my name?

1013
01:07:44,146 --> 01:07:48,841
Acutally, I still text
with the youngest, Da-song.

1014
01:07:48,942 --> 01:07:53,512
I came knowing that the family
would be away camping.

1015
01:07:53,613 --> 01:07:56,390
I wanted to speak with you, privately.

1016
01:07:56,491 --> 01:07:57,666
"Talking about."

1017
01:08:00,203 --> 01:08:02,521
Don't worry,
big sister Chung-sook.

1018
01:08:02,622 --> 01:08:06,359
I cut the wire to the
CCTV by the gate.

1019
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:10,071
Nobody knows I'm here.
I did a good job, right sister?

1020
01:08:10,172 --> 01:08:12,239
Sister this, sister that...
Do you know me?

1021
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:15,309
Sister, my name is
Moon-gwang.

1022
01:08:15,844 --> 01:08:19,914
This is my hubbie, Oh Geun-sae.
Say hello, honey.

1023
01:08:20,015 --> 01:08:23,334
So tasty!
But, why is your face like that?

1024
01:08:23,435 --> 01:08:26,278
Let's talk about that
another time.

1025
01:08:26,855 --> 01:08:30,758
So, while working here,
you looted the kitchen everyday

1026
01:08:30,859 --> 01:08:31,884
to feed your husband!

1027
01:08:31,985 --> 01:08:36,638
Not at all! What he eats,
I bought with my own salary!

1028
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:39,808
That's really unfair.
Really unfair.

1029
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:42,520
Then, how long has your
husband lived down here?

1030
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,464
Oh my, hold on...
has it been 4 years?

1031
01:08:45,999 --> 01:08:48,651
4 years, 3 months
and 17 days.

1032
01:08:48,752 --> 01:08:50,718
Right, it's June now.

1033
01:08:51,254 --> 01:08:57,142
Four years ago, after Mr. Nam-goong
moved away to Paris

1034
01:08:57,302 --> 01:09:00,312
and before Mr. Park's family moved in

1035
01:09:00,472 --> 01:09:03,915
I brought my husband
down here, stealth-like.

1036
01:09:04,017 --> 01:09:09,046
Rich folks have secret bunkers
in case of a North Korean invasion

1037
01:09:09,147 --> 01:09:13,676
or to hide from creditors.
It's quite common.

1038
01:09:13,776 --> 01:09:19,957
Mr. Nam-goong was very embarrassed
about having made this secrete bunker.

1039
01:09:20,116 --> 01:09:23,977
Anyway, he never mentioned it
to Mr. Park's family.

1040
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:25,396
So, only I knew about this...

1041
01:09:25,497 --> 01:09:27,982
I see, so that's how it all happened.

1042
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:32,194
Now that I know, I have no choice
but to call the police!

1043
01:09:32,294 --> 01:09:34,721
No please, sister!

1044
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:37,616
Please let's not do this to each other.
We're both needy people.

1045
01:09:37,717 --> 01:09:39,118
I'm not needy people!

1046
01:09:39,218 --> 01:09:42,997
But we are needy!

1047
01:09:43,098 --> 01:09:47,584
We have no home and no money.
All we have are debts!

1048
01:09:47,686 --> 01:09:48,836
Sister, please!

1049
01:09:48,937 --> 01:09:53,382
Even with 4 years of hiding,
debt collectors never let up.

1050
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:57,636
They're still searching for him,
threatening to mangle him.

1051
01:09:57,737 --> 01:09:59,538
You borrowed from loan sharks?

1052
01:10:00,198 --> 01:10:02,416
It's all my fault. Me.

1053
01:10:02,951 --> 01:10:04,251
The castella bakery...

1054
01:10:04,786 --> 01:10:08,564
My Taiwanese Wangshui castella
bakery business went bust

1055
01:10:08,665 --> 01:10:10,941
and I fell into big debt.

1056
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:12,801
Please take this.

1057
01:10:12,919 --> 01:10:14,303
What's this?

1058
01:10:14,838 --> 01:10:18,699
It's not much,
just a teeny weeny sum

1059
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,786
but we'll send it to you
every month.

1060
01:10:21,887 --> 01:10:23,621
In return, just
once every two days

1061
01:10:23,722 --> 01:10:27,191
please put some
food together for him.

1062
01:10:27,726 --> 01:10:30,736
No, no, ...just
once every week.

1063
01:10:31,271 --> 01:10:33,464
There's even a refrigerator.
Just once a week.

1064
01:10:33,565 --> 01:10:36,008
You've got some nerve!
I'm calling the police.

1065
01:10:36,109 --> 01:10:37,326
Sister, sister!

1066
01:10:40,363 --> 01:10:41,580
What's that?

1067
01:10:44,618 --> 01:10:46,501
Wait...
Jessica?

1068
01:10:47,037 --> 01:10:48,062
Driver Kim?

1069
01:10:48,163 --> 01:10:49,263
What is this?

1070
01:10:50,749 --> 01:10:51,816
Father, my ankle!

1071
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:53,108
Don't press it!

1072
01:10:53,209 --> 01:10:55,110
Father, my arm, my arm!

1073
01:10:55,211 --> 01:10:56,887
What are you doing calling me Father?

1074
01:11:04,429 --> 01:11:08,232
No wonder! I thought it so weird
starting with when driver Yoon was fired.

1075
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:09,458
Hey!

1076
01:11:09,559 --> 01:11:12,002
Ma'am, let's talk things over.

1077
01:11:12,103 --> 01:11:13,462
What are you, a family
of charlatans or something?

1078
01:11:13,563 --> 01:11:14,380
So, little sister...

1079
01:11:14,481 --> 01:11:16,990
Little sister, my ass, you bitch !
Shut your pie hole!

1080
01:11:17,525 --> 01:11:22,304
I'm gonna send this video to Mrs. Park.
What do you think about that?

1081
01:11:24,699 --> 01:11:26,917
No reception here
in the basement, right?

1082
01:11:27,452 --> 01:11:29,311
- This basement has good signals.
- Fuck!

1083
01:11:29,412 --> 01:11:34,024
Ma'am, to be honest, because we so
desperately needed the...

1084
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:37,152
Shut up! I don't want to hear it.
We're going down together!

1085
01:11:37,253 --> 01:11:40,489
Whether to the police or to jail,
we're going down together, everybody!

1086
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:44,101
Woman ! Are you crazy?

1087
01:11:44,636 --> 01:11:49,623
If Mr. and Mrs. Park see that video,
how shocked they will be!

1088
01:11:49,724 --> 01:11:53,110
Those nice people...
what fault is it of their's?

1089
01:11:53,461 --> 01:11:54,461
Why do this to them?

1090
01:11:54,562 --> 01:11:56,255
Don't come any closer!

1091
01:11:56,356 --> 01:11:58,716
Or, I'll press the 'send' button.

1092
01:11:58,817 --> 01:12:00,784
Follow me.

1093
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:03,745
Ma'am, please calm down.

1094
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:11,878
Let's go up, honey.

1095
01:12:12,414 --> 01:12:15,299
Time for you to breath
some fresh air!

1096
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:38,655
Honey, this 'send' button
is like a missile launcher.

1097
01:12:38,815 --> 01:12:40,574
What do you mean, honey?

1098
01:12:41,151 --> 01:12:46,430
If we threaten to push this button,
those people can't do anything.

1099
01:12:46,531 --> 01:12:51,043
It's like a North Korean rocket.
A North Korean missile button!

1100
01:12:52,579 --> 01:12:56,023
Today our beloved
Great Leader, Kim Jong-un

1101
01:12:56,124 --> 01:12:59,193
after witnessing the video of
the family of charlatans

1102
01:12:59,294 --> 01:13:02,029
was unable to contain
his shock and fury

1103
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:05,366
at their wicked,
despicable provocations!

1104
01:13:05,467 --> 01:13:07,242
I've missed this, honey!

1105
01:13:07,343 --> 01:13:11,872
Therefore, our Great Leader
in this age of de-nuclearization

1106
01:13:11,973 --> 01:13:17,753
has commanded that the nation's
last remaining nuclear warhead

1107
01:13:17,854 --> 01:13:20,339
be driven down the throats
of this wicked family!

1108
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:25,135
No one can imitate North Korean news
anchors like you ! I love you, honey!

1109
01:13:25,236 --> 01:13:30,265
With their stinking guts serving
as the last nuclear graveyard

1110
01:13:30,366 --> 01:13:35,270
our Dear Leader's wish to de-nuclearize
and bring world peace...

1111
01:13:35,371 --> 01:13:37,381
Hands in the air, assholes!

1112
01:13:37,916 --> 01:13:39,049
Higher!

1113
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,987
You fucking family.

1114
01:13:43,088 --> 01:13:44,162
Husband?

1115
01:13:44,263 --> 01:13:45,072
Husband.

1116
01:13:45,173 --> 01:13:45,956
Wife?

1117
01:13:46,057 --> 01:13:46,907
Yes.

1118
01:13:47,008 --> 01:13:48,008
Son?

1119
01:13:48,109 --> 01:13:48,875
Yes.

1120
01:13:48,976 --> 01:13:50,035
- Daughter?
- Daughter.

1121
01:13:50,136 --> 01:13:52,079
You low-lifes!

1122
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:56,542
All you can think to do is,
to drink yourselves like dogs?

1123
01:13:56,643 --> 01:14:01,922
In the center of Mr. Nam-goon's living room
where his creative soul dwells?

1124
01:14:02,023 --> 01:14:03,048
You cretins!

1125
01:14:03,149 --> 01:14:04,466
What do you know of art?

1126
01:14:04,567 --> 01:14:06,827
What would they know?

1127
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:15,410
On a sunny day, the two of us
would bask in the sunbeam

1128
01:14:16,246 --> 01:14:20,882
and in those moments,
we could feel his artistic touch.

1129
01:15:08,756 --> 01:15:12,267
Give it to me!

1130
01:15:31,321 --> 01:15:34,831
Good job! Delete it!

1131
01:15:35,867 --> 01:15:38,460
Careful! Don't press
'send' by accident.

1132
01:15:53,009 --> 01:15:54,109
Hello?

1133
01:15:54,636 --> 01:15:58,146
Listen, you know how to make
Chapa-guri, right?

1134
01:15:58,681 --> 01:15:59,915
Chapa-guri?

1135
01:16:00,016 --> 01:16:03,693
Chapa-guri is Da-song's favorite.

1136
01:16:03,853 --> 01:16:07,548
If you boil the water right away,
the timing will be perfect.

1137
01:16:07,649 --> 01:16:10,384
There's premium Korean sirloin
in the fridge, add that too.

1138
01:16:10,485 --> 01:16:12,010
Then, the camp...?

1139
01:16:12,111 --> 01:16:15,830
My god, what a disaster!

1140
01:16:16,366 --> 01:16:21,628
Nearby river overflowed and
caused a chaos of campers packing up.

1141
01:16:21,746 --> 01:16:24,773
Da-song was crying and throwing
a tantrum, refusing to go home!

1142
01:16:24,874 --> 01:16:29,010
Anyway, Chapa-guri to be served
immediately upon our arrival, okay?

1143
01:16:29,128 --> 01:16:31,613
Then, you're almost here?

1144
01:16:31,714 --> 01:16:34,266
8 minutes, according to the GPS.

1145
01:16:34,659 --> 01:16:35,659
Arrival in 8 minutes...

1146
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,479
Hang up the phone
and put the water on.

1147
01:16:43,518 --> 01:16:45,235
What the hell is Chapa-guri?

1148
01:16:54,279 --> 01:16:56,079
Get up, quickly!

1149
01:16:57,865 --> 01:16:58,965
Move!

1150
01:17:09,516 --> 01:17:12,163
Father! I can't do this!

1151
01:17:23,433 --> 01:17:25,317
Why are you doing this?

1152
01:17:26,436 --> 01:17:28,278
Father!

1153
01:17:31,316 --> 01:17:34,534
Go up quickly! Quickly!

1154
01:17:42,076 --> 01:17:43,176
Hey, this!

1155
01:18:02,513 --> 01:18:03,705
You're home!

1156
01:18:03,806 --> 01:18:07,150
Da-song, look!
Let's eat Chapa-guri!

1157
01:18:09,312 --> 01:18:10,820
Da-song!

1158
01:18:13,441 --> 01:18:15,450
Da-song!

1159
01:18:21,991 --> 01:18:23,375
Madame!

1160
01:18:41,969 --> 01:18:43,829
Maybe you'll have to
eat the Chapa-guri.

1161
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:44,705
Your sure?

1162
01:18:44,806 --> 01:18:47,874
No, wait. I can give it to
Das-song's dad.

1163
01:18:47,975 --> 01:18:50,068
There's premium
Korean sirloin in here.

1164
01:18:52,605 --> 01:18:56,366
The meat is cooked through to the center,
right? Medium well-done.

1165
01:19:21,426 --> 01:19:27,331
! Returning after a day's work. !
! I love you so much, Mr. Park! <i>I</i>

1166
01:19:27,432 --> 01:19:33,945
! Home from the office, <i>I
I</i> Mr. Park is off duty now. <i>I</i>

1167
01:19:35,606 --> 01:19:39,885
! Returning after a day's work, !
! I love you so much, Mr. Park! <i>I</i>

1168
01:19:39,986 --> 01:19:42,078
- What's this?
- Silence!

1169
01:19:53,624 --> 01:19:56,026
Honey, do you want some
Chapa-guri?

1170
01:19:56,127 --> 01:19:57,152
Da-song doesn't want it?

1171
01:19:57,253 --> 01:19:57,903
No.

1172
01:19:58,004 --> 01:19:59,929
No, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

1173
01:20:00,465 --> 01:20:03,224
Why are you staring at me like that?
It's embarrassing.

1174
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:07,746
Mr. Park. Today, you
feed me again and house me.

1175
01:20:07,847 --> 01:20:09,355
Respect!

1176
01:20:11,392 --> 01:20:13,067
You do this every day?

1177
01:20:13,603 --> 01:20:19,073
Sure, I even send entire
sentences to thank him.

1178
01:20:19,609 --> 01:20:21,718
Someone of your age should know this.

1179
01:20:21,819 --> 01:20:22,677
What?

1180
01:20:22,778 --> 01:20:24,579
Morse Code.

1181
01:20:25,156 --> 01:20:29,167
That sensor's going batty.

1182
01:20:37,335 --> 01:20:40,862
Da-song should know it,
since he's a Scout.

1183
01:20:40,963 --> 01:20:42,656
It looks ridiculous,
doesn't it?

1184
01:20:42,757 --> 01:20:46,243
Why make so much fuss
trying to please a kid.

1185
01:20:46,344 --> 01:20:48,328
He's not even some kind of prince.

1186
01:20:48,429 --> 01:20:51,189
He's the youngest.
It's understandable.

1187
01:20:52,225 --> 01:20:53,733
Please understand.

1188
01:20:54,268 --> 01:20:58,029
Da-song is a bit...
shall we say, unwell?

1189
01:20:58,272 --> 01:21:01,324
He's receiving treatment for
trauma, art therapy, etc.

1190
01:21:02,235 --> 01:21:04,261
There was an incident.

1191
01:21:04,362 --> 01:21:05,745
What kind of...?

1192
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:09,958
You believe in demons, don't you?

1193
01:21:11,077 --> 01:21:15,004
When he was in the 1st grade,
Da-song saw a demon in the house.

1194
01:21:21,546 --> 01:21:23,947
In the 1st grade, the day we had
his birthday party at home.

1195
01:21:24,048 --> 01:21:26,491
Late that night, when
everyone was sleeping

1196
01:21:26,592 --> 01:21:31,163
Da-song crept down to the kitchen
and took out the leftover cake.

1197
01:21:31,264 --> 01:21:34,332
The fresh whipped cream
on that cake was amazing.

1198
01:21:34,433 --> 01:21:37,360
Lying in his bed, he couldn't get
the cake out of his mind.

1199
01:21:37,895 --> 01:21:43,283
So, Da-song was sitting there
eating his cake when...

1200
01:21:52,827 --> 01:21:55,795
He screamed, "Kyaaaa ! ! !"
and I ran downstairs.

1201
01:21:56,330 --> 01:21:58,298
And, he was all...

1202
01:21:58,833 --> 01:22:04,178
his eyes rolled back, shaking in
convulsion, foaming at the mouth.

1203
01:22:06,215 --> 01:22:08,450
Have you ever seen your
own child go into a seizure?

1204
01:22:08,551 --> 01:22:09,284
No.

1205
01:22:09,385 --> 01:22:14,664
If you can't treat it within
15-minutes, it's all over.

1206
01:22:14,765 --> 01:22:19,944
That's the maximum time you have
to reach the ER. 15 minutes.

1207
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:25,717
You can actually live like this?
In a place like this?

1208
01:22:25,818 --> 01:22:29,012
There's plenty more people
that live underground.

1209
01:22:29,113 --> 01:22:31,014
There's even more
if you count the semi-basements.

1210
01:22:31,115 --> 01:22:35,710
What are you going to do next?
You don't even have a plan, do you?

1211
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:39,505
I just feel comfortable here. Just so.

1212
01:22:40,583 --> 01:22:43,801
It feels like I was born here.

1213
01:22:44,462 --> 01:22:47,739
Maybe, I had my wedding here, too.

1214
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,267
As for the National Pension,
it doesn't apply to me.

1215
01:22:52,386 --> 01:22:56,022
You live out your old age
on nothing but affection.

1216
01:22:57,558 --> 01:23:02,946
So please, let me
continue to live down here.

1217
01:23:04,482 --> 01:23:06,199
Anyway...

1218
01:23:06,734 --> 01:23:11,788
My husband was away on business,
so I had to deal the utter chaos.

1219
01:23:12,406 --> 01:23:16,726
Since then, we've always
gone out for his birthdays.

1220
01:23:16,827 --> 01:23:19,854
Last year at my mother's house.
This year, the camping trip.

1221
01:23:19,955 --> 01:23:24,818
Da-song's dad says
all kids grow up like that.

1222
01:23:24,919 --> 01:23:29,764
He said, living in a house once possessed by a
demon is good for business and prosperity.

1223
01:23:30,925 --> 01:23:35,937
Actually, the business has been
very good the last few years.

1224
01:24:02,498 --> 01:24:04,549
Oh, man...

1225
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:34,037
Stay here for now.

1226
01:24:44,623 --> 01:24:46,674
Zoonie, what's wrong?

1227
01:24:48,711 --> 01:24:50,219
Something under there?

1228
01:24:51,797 --> 01:24:53,556
What is it?

1229
01:24:54,592 --> 01:24:55,808
Damn it!

1230
01:24:57,344 --> 01:24:58,370
- Mom !
- Yeah?

1231
01:24:58,471 --> 01:25:00,872
- How could you?
- What?

1232
01:25:00,973 --> 01:25:05,093
I like Chapa-guri too!
How could you not ask me, even once?

1233
01:25:05,194 --> 01:25:05,919
Well...

1234
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:10,090
Da-song didn't want it,
so you asked Dad, then ate it yourself.

1235
01:25:10,191 --> 01:25:11,007
Want to ask ajumma
to make some more?

1236
01:25:11,108 --> 01:25:13,009
No, that's not the point!

1237
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:16,805
- Why are you fussing over ramen noodles!
- Why didn't you ask me?

1238
01:25:16,906 --> 01:25:20,416
Oh, stop it! Go to bed, quickly.
Go get changed into your pajamas.

1239
01:25:23,996 --> 01:25:25,588
This way!

1240
01:25:26,844 --> 01:25:27,683
Shhh!

1241
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:31,344
Ki-jung is under there!
Hurry, hurry!

1242
01:25:34,507 --> 01:25:36,825
One, two, three!
One, two, three!

1243
01:25:36,926 --> 01:25:38,368
Da-song, what are you doing?

1244
01:25:38,469 --> 01:25:41,187
Da-song!

1245
01:25:41,722 --> 01:25:44,190
He's crazy! Crazy!
Umbrella, please.

1246
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:45,858
Hey, Park Da-song!

1247
01:25:47,394 --> 01:25:52,173
Son of a gun...
What the hell is he doing?

1248
01:25:52,274 --> 01:25:56,052
Da-song, it's time for bed !
Do you know what time it is?

1249
01:25:56,153 --> 01:25:57,253
Here.

1250
01:25:58,197 --> 01:25:59,497
Honey, take this.

1251
01:26:03,077 --> 01:26:09,757
Who do you take after to be
so stubborn? Look at this rain!

1252
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:26,149
Channel 3 for emergencies!
Keep it turned on.

1253
01:26:26,725 --> 01:26:29,919
Give it to me.
I can't believe him.

1254
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:32,655
Just leave him be.
He'll come in when he's tired.

1255
01:26:35,951 --> 01:26:36,926
Hey, Da-hye!

1256
01:26:37,027 --> 01:26:39,620
Why are you on your phone
so much? Go to bed.

1257
01:26:40,155 --> 01:26:42,599
Go on to your room and sleep.
We'll take care of things here.

1258
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:45,727
This is the living room,
do you copy?

1259
01:26:45,828 --> 01:26:46,936
Copy, over.

1260
01:26:47,037 --> 01:26:51,232
Daddy is standing by for
emergencies, over.

1261
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:54,093
Got it, over.

1262
01:26:55,129 --> 01:26:57,071
I suppose that tent is not going to leak?

1263
01:26:57,172 --> 01:27:00,492
That's U.S. made.
It'll be fine.

1264
01:27:00,593 --> 01:27:03,620
- Should we sleep here on the sofa?
- What?

1265
01:27:03,721 --> 01:27:05,914
We have a direct line of sight to the tent.

1266
01:27:06,015 --> 01:27:07,874
Good idea.
I'll feel much better.

1267
01:27:07,975 --> 01:27:08,708
Right?

1268
01:27:08,809 --> 01:27:10,818
Let's sleep while
watching over Da-song.

1269
01:27:12,855 --> 01:27:14,280
That son of a gun.

1270
01:27:23,824 --> 01:27:25,041
Wait a minute!

1271
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:29,604
That stench is coming
from somewhere.

1272
01:27:29,705 --> 01:27:31,130
What stench?

1273
01:27:31,665 --> 01:27:33,007
Driver Kim's smell.

1274
01:27:33,542 --> 01:27:34,926
- Driver Kim?
- Yeah.

1275
01:27:35,544 --> 01:27:36,903
Not sure.

1276
01:27:37,004 --> 01:27:40,181
Really? You must know it already.

1277
01:27:40,716 --> 01:27:44,285
That stench that wafts through the car.
...how to describe it?

1278
01:27:44,386 --> 01:27:46,746
- An old man's smell?
- No no, it's not that.

1279
01:27:46,847 --> 01:27:49,106
Then, what is it?

1280
01:27:49,642 --> 01:27:51,525
Like old dried radish?

1281
01:27:52,144 --> 01:27:53,361
No.

1282
01:27:53,479 --> 01:27:55,713
You know that smell
when you boil a rag?

1283
01:27:55,814 --> 01:27:57,198
It smells like that.

1284
01:27:59,735 --> 01:28:06,099
Anyway, although he always seems
like he's about to cross the line

1285
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:09,435
he never actually crosses it.
That's good.

1286
01:28:09,536 --> 01:28:11,170
- I'll give him credit for that.
- Yeah.

1287
01:28:12,289 --> 01:28:15,049
But that stink,
that crosses the line.

1288
01:28:15,584 --> 01:28:17,802
It powers right through
to the back seat.

1289
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,696
What smell is it?

1290
01:28:19,797 --> 01:28:21,013
I don't know.

1291
01:28:22,049 --> 01:28:24,433
It's hard to describe in words.

1292
01:28:25,469 --> 01:28:28,913
But you sometimes
smell it on the subways.

1293
01:28:29,014 --> 01:28:32,441
It's been ages since I rode a subway.

1294
01:28:32,977 --> 01:28:35,920
People who ride the subway
have that unique smell.

1295
01:28:36,021 --> 01:28:37,446
Yeah.

1296
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:56,632
Isn't this like the back seat of my car?

1297
01:28:57,292 --> 01:29:00,761
What if Da-song comes back in?

1298
01:29:01,296 --> 01:29:02,930
Don't worry!

1299
01:29:03,465 --> 01:29:06,142
I can just pull my hand back.

1300
01:29:11,682 --> 01:29:13,316
We shouldn't...

1301
01:29:19,857 --> 01:29:21,240
Clockwise.

1302
01:29:21,775 --> 01:29:22,875
Right.

1303
01:29:26,238 --> 01:29:29,540
You know where.

1304
01:29:46,091 --> 01:29:49,602
You still have those cheap panties?

1305
01:29:49,782 --> 01:29:50,882
Huh?

1306
01:29:51,138 --> 01:29:53,898
The one Yoon's bitch left behind.

1307
01:29:55,017 --> 01:29:58,110
If you wear those,
fuck, it'll turn me on.

1308
01:29:58,645 --> 01:29:59,987
Really?

1309
01:30:00,522 --> 01:30:03,532
Then get me some drugs.

1310
01:30:04,109 --> 01:30:07,703
Get me some drugs!

1311
01:30:08,781 --> 01:30:10,247
Take this instead.

1312
01:30:22,294 --> 01:30:23,427
You like it?

1313
01:31:21,019 --> 01:31:23,446
Emergency!
Emergency, over!

1314
01:31:25,983 --> 01:31:27,366
- Emergency!
- What?

1315
01:31:28,385 --> 01:31:29,385
What is it? Over.

1316
01:31:29,486 --> 01:31:31,054
Da-song, what's wrong?

1317
01:31:31,155 --> 01:31:33,622
I can't sleep, over.

1318
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:37,643
So stop it and come in, okay?

1319
01:31:37,744 --> 01:31:40,396
Go sleep in your soft bed, over.

1320
01:31:40,497 --> 01:31:41,814
Right!

1321
01:31:41,915 --> 01:31:44,258
I don't want to, over.

1322
01:31:44,793 --> 01:31:46,218
Hey, Park Da-song.

1323
01:31:51,383 --> 01:31:53,726
Let's just sleep...

1324
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:32,241
What happened back there?

1325
01:33:33,277 --> 01:33:34,377
What?

1326
01:33:36,697 --> 01:33:38,747
The people in the basement.

1327
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:45,838
Well, I tied them up real tight.

1328
01:33:46,290 --> 01:33:48,299
What are you going to do?

1329
01:33:49,418 --> 01:33:50,593
Huh?

1330
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:56,307
What are you going to do now?
What's your plan?

1331
01:33:56,925 --> 01:34:00,019
I've been wondering...

1332
01:34:00,762 --> 01:34:04,148
What Min-hyuk would do
in a situation like this.

1333
01:34:05,684 --> 01:34:08,027
Min-hyuk oppa would never be
in a sitution like this!

1334
01:34:10,063 --> 01:34:15,743
Look kids, we made it out
of there safely, right?

1335
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:22,183
And besides us, nobody knows
what happened there, right?

1336
01:34:22,284 --> 01:34:25,210
So, nothing happened.
Understand?

1337
01:34:26,288 --> 01:34:30,883
My thoughts are...
because I have a plan

1338
01:34:31,418 --> 01:34:35,137
I want you two to just
forget about all this, okay?

1339
01:34:35,672 --> 01:34:37,222
Let's go home.

1340
01:34:38,258 --> 01:34:40,309
Let's go and wash up, ok?

1341
01:34:58,945 --> 01:35:01,455
What are you doing there?
Hurry down!

1342
01:35:15,003 --> 01:35:17,262
What is all this?

1343
01:35:19,383 --> 01:35:22,118
You stay put!
This is all sewer shit water.

1344
01:35:22,219 --> 01:35:24,645
Our window was left open?

1345
01:35:29,184 --> 01:35:32,111
Big brother!
Help me out with this!

1346
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,745
Hey, Ki-woo!

1347
01:35:44,282 --> 01:35:47,251
Hey, Ki-woo, close the window!
The window!

1348
01:35:48,286 --> 01:35:50,462
Did you get electrocuted?

1349
01:35:57,087 --> 01:35:58,804
So dizzy.

1350
01:36:02,384 --> 01:36:06,437
Hold still. Keep still.

1351
01:36:11,977 --> 01:36:13,777
Shit, I feel dizzy.

1352
01:36:17,816 --> 01:36:20,367
Ki-jung, be careful!

1353
01:36:21,903 --> 01:36:23,454
Don't touch anything!

1354
01:36:36,001 --> 01:36:41,655
Honey, I must have a concussion.

1355
01:36:41,756 --> 01:36:44,600
I can't see you.

1356
01:37:05,697 --> 01:37:10,459
Honey, sister Chung-sook is

1357
01:37:10,994 --> 01:37:15,810
really a nice person.

1358
01:37:16,917 --> 01:37:20,738
But, she shoved me with her foot.

1359
01:37:22,881 --> 01:37:24,932
Repeat after me.

1360
01:37:25,467 --> 01:37:28,185
Chung-sook.

1361
01:37:29,721 --> 01:37:33,148
Chung-sook.

1362
01:37:42,067 --> 01:37:44,368
Ki-woo!

1363
01:37:45,153 --> 01:37:46,762
What at are you doing over there?

1364
01:37:46,863 --> 01:37:47,963
Huh?

1365
01:38:02,963 --> 01:38:07,099
H. E. L. P. M ...

1366
01:39:12,407 --> 01:39:13,624
Father?

1367
01:39:14,284 --> 01:39:15,584
Huh?

1368
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:20,339
What is that plan from earlier?

1369
01:39:21,916 --> 01:39:23,926
What are you talking about?

1370
01:39:24,961 --> 01:39:27,679
Earlier, you said you had a plan.

1371
01:39:28,214 --> 01:39:30,182
What are you going to do? There...

1372
01:39:30,759 --> 01:39:32,017
in the basement.

1373
01:39:33,053 --> 01:39:38,774
Ki-woo, you know
what kind of plan never fails?

1374
01:39:40,352 --> 01:39:42,878
A 'Non-Plan.' A non-plan.

1375
01:39:42,979 --> 01:39:44,655
"No plan."

1376
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:46,740
You know why?

1377
01:39:48,777 --> 01:39:55,457
If you make a plan,
life never turns out that way.

1378
01:39:55,992 --> 01:39:57,501
Look around here.

1379
01:39:58,036 --> 01:40:03,674
You think all these people planned in droves,
"Let's spend the night in a gym"?

1380
01:40:04,209 --> 01:40:06,176
But, look now.

1381
01:40:06,336 --> 01:40:10,347
Everyone's sleeping on the
gym floor, us included.

1382
01:40:11,883 --> 01:40:15,310
That's why people
shouldn't have plans.

1383
01:40:17,347 --> 01:40:21,125
With no plan,
nothing can go wrong.

1384
01:40:21,226 --> 01:40:28,115
If you start out without a plan, even if something
spins out of control, it doesn't matter.

1385
01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:32,119
Whether you kill someone
or betray your country.

1386
01:40:33,655 --> 01:40:37,290
None of it fucking matters.
Got it?

1387
01:40:38,952 --> 01:40:40,419
Father.

1388
01:40:42,455 --> 01:40:44,047
I'm sorry.

1389
01:40:44,666 --> 01:40:46,508
For what, son?

1390
01:40:49,546 --> 01:40:51,179
Everything.

1391
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,640
All of it.

1392
01:40:55,677 --> 01:40:57,978
I'll take the responsibility.

1393
01:40:58,513 --> 01:41:00,731
What are you talking about?

1394
01:41:02,767 --> 01:41:05,360
Why are you embracing
that rock like that?

1395
01:41:05,979 --> 01:41:07,696
This?

1396
01:41:13,236 --> 01:41:16,371
It keeps clinging to me.

1397
01:41:18,408 --> 01:41:22,794
You'd better get some sleep.

1398
01:41:25,832 --> 01:41:27,424
Really!

1399
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,553
It keeps following me.

1400
01:41:44,601 --> 01:41:46,460
Teacher Jessica?
Sorry to call on a Sunday morning.

1401
01:41:46,561 --> 01:41:48,921
Are you free for lunch today?

1402
01:41:49,022 --> 01:41:52,783
We're having an impromptu
birthday for Da-song.

1403
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:56,095
Are you having a birthday party?

1404
01:41:56,196 --> 01:41:59,623
If you come too,
Da-song will be so very happy.

1405
01:41:59,824 --> 01:42:03,960
And have as much pasta, gratin,
and salmon steak as you want.

1406
01:42:04,078 --> 01:42:06,188
People will be here by 1pm
so be here by then.

1407
01:42:06,289 --> 01:42:09,400
And I'll count today
as one of your sessions.

1408
01:42:09,501 --> 01:42:12,052
You know what I mean?
See you later!

1409
01:42:13,296 --> 01:42:14,738
- Mom.
- Yeah?

1410
01:42:14,839 --> 01:42:18,492
For the impromptu birthday
should we invite teacher Kevin too?

1411
01:42:18,593 --> 01:42:21,370
Great idea! Why not?
Will you contact him?

1412
01:42:21,471 --> 01:42:25,374
Get some more sleep! You need to rest.
You had a rough day yesterday.

1413
01:42:25,475 --> 01:42:29,628
If you're doing a party,
won't you need to do the rounds?

1414
01:42:29,729 --> 01:42:34,116
Right, the wine shop,
supermarket, bakery, florist...

1415
01:42:34,943 --> 01:42:37,577
I already told driver Kim to hurry over.

1416
01:42:37,695 --> 01:42:39,388
I'll pay him overtime.

1417
01:42:39,489 --> 01:42:40,589
Perfect!

1418
01:42:51,125 --> 01:42:54,803
Everyone, calm down, calm down!

1419
01:43:02,679 --> 01:43:05,998
In the basement...

1420
01:43:06,099 --> 01:43:08,375
we have about 10 outdoor tables.

1421
01:43:08,476 --> 01:43:12,362
First take them all out,
then arrange them...

1422
01:43:13,022 --> 01:43:16,241
No, come to the window.
I need to show you.

1423
01:43:17,944 --> 01:43:19,720
With Da-song's tent in the middle

1424
01:43:19,821 --> 01:43:23,356
Set the tables outward in a curve...

1425
01:43:23,457 --> 01:43:25,601
A crane-wing formation!

1426
01:43:25,702 --> 01:43:28,987
Like Admiral Yi used. You remember
Battle of The Hansan Island?

1427
01:43:29,088 --> 01:43:31,648
Think of the tent as the
Japanese warship.

1428
01:43:31,749 --> 01:43:37,029
And our tables in the crane-wing formation
in a semi-circular fashion.

1429
01:43:37,130 --> 01:43:41,325
Then near the tent will be the
barbeque grill, firewood and such

1430
01:43:41,426 --> 01:43:43,627
all nicely arranged.

1431
01:43:43,728 --> 01:43:47,589
That will be great!
Bring your husband too!

1432
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:48,415
Yeah!

1433
01:43:48,516 --> 01:43:52,485
And definitely no presents,
just come!

1434
01:43:53,354 --> 01:43:55,047
Dress code?

1435
01:43:55,148 --> 01:43:58,783
It's just an impromptu.
You can wear sweat pants if you want!

1436
01:43:59,819 --> 01:44:05,582
And absolutely no presents
Just come and enjoy the food.

1437
01:44:06,618 --> 01:44:08,727
You know already
my culinary skills.

1438
01:44:08,828 --> 01:44:13,965
Right! Right!
We'll drink wine in daylight.

1439
01:44:15,543 --> 01:44:19,054
If you would sing a song,
that'd be grand ! You know the one...

1440
01:44:35,104 --> 01:44:37,906
Ajumma, shhh!
He's still sleeping!

1441
01:44:38,441 --> 01:44:41,510
Today the sky's so blue,
and no yellow-dust pollution!

1442
01:44:41,611 --> 01:44:43,787
Thanks to all the rain yesterday.

1443
01:44:44,822 --> 01:44:46,056
Right.

1444
01:44:46,157 --> 01:44:50,252
So we traded camping
for a garden party. Deal!

1445
01:44:51,287 --> 01:44:53,088
It's lemons into lemonade.

1446
01:44:56,209 --> 01:45:01,263
Right, what would we have done
if not for the rain!

1447
01:45:02,799 --> 01:45:07,310
And definitely no presents.
I mean it!

1448
01:45:07,845 --> 01:45:11,731
Right, you've got the Mini Cooper so,
we'll just squeeze it into our garage.

1449
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Go on up!

1450
01:45:13,101 --> 01:45:18,013
Back it in tight.
Just don't block the Benz.

1451
01:45:18,114 --> 01:45:21,214
You're here!
It's been so long!

1452
01:45:24,237 --> 01:45:26,579
I told you no presents!

1453
01:45:44,632 --> 01:45:46,766
Oppa, you were thinking
of something else.

1454
01:45:46,926 --> 01:45:48,310
What?

1455
01:45:49,345 --> 01:45:52,522
While we were kissing, you were
thinking of something else.

1456
01:45:54,642 --> 01:45:55,900
No.

1457
01:45:56,936 --> 01:46:00,572
What do you mean, no?
You're still doing it.

1458
01:46:03,109 --> 01:46:04,367
Wow.

1459
01:46:05,987 --> 01:46:08,705
Everyone looks great, right?

1460
01:46:10,116 --> 01:46:13,877
Even for an impromptu,
they all look so cool

1461
01:46:14,746 --> 01:46:17,130
and so natural.

1462
01:46:19,167 --> 01:46:20,425
Da-hye.

1463
01:46:23,004 --> 01:46:24,637
Do I fit in well?

1464
01:46:26,015 --> 01:46:27,741
What?

1465
01:46:28,676 --> 01:46:31,686
Do I fit in well here?

1466
01:46:41,606 --> 01:46:43,823
Why? Where are you going?

1467
01:46:44,358 --> 01:46:45,575
I need to go down.

1468
01:46:46,110 --> 01:46:48,119
Just hang out with me.

1469
01:46:49,113 --> 01:46:51,039
I need to go below.

1470
01:46:51,449 --> 01:46:56,461
With all those boring people?
Can't you just hangout with me?

1471
01:46:57,455 --> 01:47:01,733
Not to those people.
Down lower.

1472
01:47:01,834 --> 01:47:04,761
Wow, what is that?

1473
01:47:07,799 --> 01:47:11,684
Really, I can't believe
we're doing this at our age.

1474
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:14,187
It's embarrassing.

1475
01:47:15,223 --> 01:47:16,665
I'm really sorry, driver Kim.

1476
01:47:16,766 --> 01:47:19,960
It's at my wife's insistence.
I can't do anything about it.

1477
01:47:20,061 --> 01:47:21,628
But the concept is simple.

1478
01:47:21,729 --> 01:47:27,050
Teacher Jessica will carry out
the birthday cake in a little parade.

1479
01:47:27,151 --> 01:47:31,138
Then, we jump out
and attack teacher Jessica

1480
01:47:31,239 --> 01:47:33,473
swinging our Indian tomahawks!

1481
01:47:33,574 --> 01:47:34,349
Ah, right.

1482
01:47:34,450 --> 01:47:39,879
Just then, Da-song the good Indian
will jump out and we'll do battle.

1483
01:47:40,039 --> 01:47:44,609
Ultimately, he'll save the cake goddess Jessica,
and they will all give a big cheer.

1484
01:47:44,710 --> 01:47:46,302
Something like that.

1485
01:47:47,447 --> 01:47:48,447
Silly, isn't it?

1486
01:47:48,548 --> 01:47:53,368
I guess your wife likes
events and surprises.

1487
01:47:53,469 --> 01:47:55,562
Yeah, she does.

1488
01:47:55,721 --> 01:47:58,690
But she's particularly into this party.

1489
01:48:00,226 --> 01:48:03,194
You're trying your best, too.

1490
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:07,198
Well, because
you love her, after all.

1491
01:48:12,738 --> 01:48:13,838
Driver Kim.

1492
01:48:15,491 --> 01:48:18,126
You know today is your work day.

1493
01:48:23,291 --> 01:48:27,635
Think of this as an
extension of your work, okay?

1494
01:48:38,931 --> 01:48:40,582
Have you been down there?

1495
01:48:40,683 --> 01:48:44,419
- No, not yet.
- Shouldn't we have a talk with them?

1496
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,338
In a way that is
good for everyone?

1497
01:48:46,439 --> 01:48:47,380
Exactly!

1498
01:48:47,481 --> 01:48:50,258
We all got too fucking
worked up last night!

1499
01:48:50,359 --> 01:48:54,287
I know! And, dad was going on
about some plan...

1500
01:48:54,697 --> 01:48:57,140
- No, I'm going down there now.
- Hold on!

1501
01:48:57,241 --> 01:48:59,434
Take this down to them.

1502
01:48:59,535 --> 01:49:01,144
- They must be hungry.
- Right.

1503
01:49:01,245 --> 01:49:03,213
Let them eat first.

1504
01:49:05,124 --> 01:49:06,758
Come next time for sure!

1505
01:49:07,793 --> 01:49:09,528
Here you are, Jessica.

1506
01:49:09,629 --> 01:49:11,988
- This is too good !
- Yes, to die for!

1507
01:49:12,089 --> 01:49:14,574
I've got a special favor to ask.

1508
01:49:14,675 --> 01:49:15,850
What kind?

1509
01:49:16,093 --> 01:49:18,161
This is...
how to describe it?

1510
01:49:18,262 --> 01:49:20,205
Da-song's trauma
recovery cake?

1511
01:49:20,306 --> 01:49:23,775
So, it needs to be you who does this.
Today's highlight!

1512
01:50:46,726 --> 01:50:50,111
Excuse me...
Are you ok?

1513
01:50:55,151 --> 01:50:56,659
Excuse me...

1514
01:51:06,704 --> 01:51:08,004
Mister! Mister!

1515
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:58,030
Oppa? Oppa?

1516
01:53:04,572 --> 01:53:07,307
Da-song !
Happy birthday!

1517
01:53:07,408 --> 01:53:08,875
Congratulations!

1518
01:53:16,128 --> 01:53:17,554
Oh, fuck!

1519
01:53:27,229 --> 01:53:29,329
Stop!!

1520
01:53:29,430 --> 01:53:31,539
Sister Chung-sook!

1521
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:32,415
Ki-jung!

1522
01:53:32,516 --> 01:53:34,125
Come on out, Chung-sook!

1523
01:53:34,226 --> 01:53:37,636
Stop the bleeding!
Push down on the wound!

1524
01:53:42,098 --> 01:53:43,533
Da-song!

1525
01:53:44,189 --> 01:53:45,408
Honey!

1526
01:53:46,590 --> 01:53:48,315
Let go!
Don't do it!

1527
01:53:59,666 --> 01:54:01,429
It hurts!

1528
01:54:05,927 --> 01:54:07,117
The ER!

1529
01:54:07,218 --> 01:54:08,751
Get the car out!
The car!

1530
01:54:08,852 --> 01:54:10,395
Driver Kim !
What the fuck are you doing?!

1531
01:54:10,496 --> 01:54:12,622
If we wait for the ambulance,
it'll be too late!

1532
01:54:12,723 --> 01:54:15,133
Dad, dad!
Stop pressing it.

1533
01:54:15,234 --> 01:54:18,194
Pressing it makes it
hurt more.

1534
01:54:18,854 --> 01:54:20,004
Give me the car key!
The car key!

1535
01:54:20,105 --> 01:54:22,922
Throw them !
Just throw me the key!

1536
01:54:40,542 --> 01:54:42,118
You okay?

1537
01:54:42,219 --> 01:54:44,220
Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!

1538
01:54:46,291 --> 01:54:48,808
How do you do, Mr. Park?

1539
01:54:48,926 --> 01:54:49,993
You know me?

1540
01:54:50,094 --> 01:54:51,769
Respect!

1541
01:56:18,432 --> 01:56:21,793
A month later when I opened my eyes,
the first face that I saw...

1542
01:56:21,894 --> 01:56:23,694
was that of a detective.

1543
01:56:23,854 --> 01:56:28,633
You have the right to an attorney...

1544
01:56:28,734 --> 01:56:31,035
He looked nothing
like a detective.

1545
01:56:35,574 --> 01:56:37,267
Is he laughing?

1546
01:56:37,368 --> 01:56:39,043
Just a moment.

1547
01:56:39,453 --> 01:56:44,298
Then, the doctor who looked
nothing like a doctor spoke.

1548
01:56:45,334 --> 01:56:49,112
That happens sometimes
immediately after brain surgery.

1549
01:56:49,213 --> 01:56:51,430
They keep laughing
for no reason.

1550
01:56:52,091 --> 01:56:54,308
Can you hear me?

1551
01:56:54,551 --> 01:56:56,435
Can you hear me, now?

1552
01:56:56,553 --> 01:56:58,329
Then, we have to do it again?

1553
01:56:58,430 --> 01:56:59,247
Do what again?

1554
01:56:59,348 --> 01:57:00,898
What I just did.
The Miranda.

1555
01:57:03,435 --> 01:57:07,255
You ! Um... have the right!
To remain silent!

1556
01:57:07,356 --> 01:57:10,091
Anything you say can and will
be used against you ...right? ...and

1557
01:57:10,192 --> 01:57:12,576
He keeps laughing, look!

1558
01:57:15,614 --> 01:57:21,711
Even when I heard how much
Ki-jung bled that day

1559
01:57:23,872 --> 01:57:31,087
even when I heard the words "document forgery,"
"trespassing," "foul play, but self-defense"

1560
01:57:31,338 --> 01:57:35,725
...and that we were lucky to get away
with just a probation...

1561
01:57:38,762 --> 01:57:41,789
even when I finally got to
see Ki-jung's face...

1562
01:57:41,890 --> 01:57:44,900
Kim Ki-jung
Nov 20, 1996 -- July 1,2018

1563
01:57:46,437 --> 01:57:48,738
I kept laughing.

1564
01:57:58,407 --> 01:58:03,895
But, when I looked back
and watched all the news reports

1565
01:58:03,996 --> 01:58:05,188
I didn't laugh much at all.

1566
01:58:57,549 --> 01:59:04,514
Mom and I actually had no idea
where father was.

1567
01:59:06,850 --> 01:59:12,530
But, those detectives trying to tail us
still wore themselves out.

1568
01:59:16,568 --> 01:59:22,540
Eventually, when the news went quiet, and
the taills became less frequent

1569
01:59:23,075 --> 01:59:26,502
I started, from time to time,
to go up that mountain.

1570
01:59:28,539 --> 01:59:33,259
From up there, you get
a good view of the house.

1571
01:59:36,004 --> 01:59:43,135
That day, despite the cold,
I felt the urge to stay behind longer.

1572
01:59:56,483 --> 01:59:59,994
Dash - dash - dot - dot

1573
02:00:04,023 --> 02:00:07,491
dot - dot - dot - dash
dash - dash - dot...

1574
02:00:28,536 --> 02:00:29,878
Son!

1575
02:00:31,852 --> 02:00:35,696
You may be able to read this letter.

1576
02:00:39,234 --> 02:00:45,539
You were a Boy Scout, so just in case,
I am writing you a letter this way.

1577
02:00:48,577 --> 02:00:51,545
Have you recovered ok
from your injuries?

1578
02:00:52,581 --> 02:00:56,884
I'm sure your mom is
plenty healthy.

1579
02:01:00,922 --> 02:01:03,724
I'm doing fine
down here.

1580
02:01:04,760 --> 02:01:07,519
Though, I often cry
thinking bout Ki-jung.

1581
02:01:10,557 --> 02:01:15,402
Even now, what happened
that day seems surreal.

1582
02:01:16,647 --> 02:01:18,364
Feels like I dreamt it all.

1583
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:21,867
Maybe I didn't.

1584
02:01:22,903 --> 02:01:27,873
That day, as I ran out the gate,
I suddenly realized

1585
02:01:28,909 --> 02:01:30,668
where I needed to go.

1586
02:02:10,075 --> 02:02:13,060
A house where such
grisly crime took place

1587
02:02:13,161 --> 02:02:16,422
is surely not so easy to sell.

1588
02:02:19,543 --> 02:02:21,944
I'm so sorry, Mr. Park.

1589
02:02:22,045 --> 02:02:28,600
So, I struggled to hold out in the
empty house until the new owners arrived.

1590
02:02:31,138 --> 02:02:34,040
Still, thanks to the
house being empty

1591
02:02:34,141 --> 02:02:39,003
What was her name?
'Moon' and 'Gwang?'

1592
02:02:39,104 --> 02:02:43,407
I was able to give lady Moon-gwang
a proper, dignified send off.

1593
02:02:44,526 --> 02:02:51,290
I gave her a tree-side burial which I hear are very
trendy these days. So, hell, I did my best.

1594
02:02:54,828 --> 02:02:58,464
But, those real estate sharks
sure are clever.

1595
02:03:03,003 --> 02:03:07,239
They hoodwinked some people
newly arrived in Korea and knowing nothing

1596
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:09,683
and ultimately managed to
sell them the house.

1597
02:03:10,802 --> 02:03:14,080
With the parents working in a foreign company
and the kids attending a foreign school,

1598
02:03:14,181 --> 02:03:16,774
the family is usually out.

1599
02:03:16,892 --> 02:03:22,321
But, the goddamned housekeeper
stays glued here 24 hours a day.

1600
02:03:22,481 --> 02:03:27,409
Each time I go upstairs to the kitchen,
I put my life on the line.

1601
02:03:29,946 --> 02:03:34,291
It turns out that Germans don't eat and
drink just sausages and beer.

1602
02:03:34,826 --> 02:03:36,877
What a relief.

1603
02:03:39,456 --> 02:03:43,842
Passing the time down here,
everything starts to go hazy.

1604
02:03:48,381 --> 02:03:52,559
Today, at least, I was able to
write you a letter.

1605
02:03:54,095 --> 02:03:57,998
If I send out the letter
this way every night

1606
02:03:58,099 --> 02:04:02,569
maybe someday
you'll see it.

1607
02:04:08,610 --> 02:04:10,661
So long for now.

1608
02:04:24,209 --> 02:04:25,276
Ki-woo?
Is that you?

1609
02:04:25,377 --> 02:04:26,477
Yes.

1610
02:04:40,892 --> 02:04:45,904
Father,
I made a plan today.

1611
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:49,366
It's a master plan.

1612
02:04:52,404 --> 02:04:54,079
I'm going to make money.

1613
02:04:54,656 --> 02:04:56,456
...loads of it.

1614
02:04:59,995 --> 02:05:04,506
University, career, marriage,
they're all fine

1615
02:05:04,666 --> 02:05:06,692
but I will first make money.

1616
02:05:06,793 --> 02:05:12,139
You'll see once you go in,
but it's very spacious.

1617
02:05:12,674 --> 02:05:17,411
Actually, we don't show
this kind of house to just anyone.

1618
02:05:17,512 --> 02:05:22,024
When I make the money,
I will first buy this house.

1619
02:05:23,059 --> 02:05:27,321
On the day we move in,
Mom and I will be in the garden.

1620
02:05:27,856 --> 02:05:30,282
Because the sunshine
is so nice there.

1621
02:05:31,443 --> 02:05:33,493
All you have to do

1622
02:05:33,653 --> 02:05:36,538
is come up the stairs.

1623
02:06:59,155 --> 02:07:03,292
Until that day comes, please
take very good care of yourself.

1624
02:07:07,956 --> 02:07:10,090
So long for now.
