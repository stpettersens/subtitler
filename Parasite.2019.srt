1
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:29,544
We're ruined!

2
00:01:29,686 --> 00:01:31,320
No more free Wi-Fi.

3
00:01:32,756 --> 00:01:33,756
Hey, Ki-jung!

4
00:01:33,857 --> 00:01:34,924
Yeah?

5
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:39,095
The woman upstairs
finally put a password on iptime.

6
00:01:39,196 --> 00:01:40,930
A password?

7
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:42,664
Did you try "123456789"?

8
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:43,808
Yeah, doesn't work.

9
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:45,309
Try it in reverse.

10
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,811
I told you, it doesn't work.

11
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:51,148
Shit! Then no text,
no Ka- Talk, no nothing?

12
00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:52,424
That's right.

13
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:55,219
Hey, Kim Ki-taek.

14
00:01:55,754 --> 00:01:59,223
Fucking don't pretend to sleep.
What do you think?

15
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:05,813
Our phones are all shut off...
Wi-Fi is all shut off...

16
00:02:06,348 --> 00:02:09,441
Fucking what's your plan?
Huh?

17
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:12,962
- Hey, Ki-woo.
- Yes, father?

18
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:16,990
For Wi-Fi, you have to hold it up high.

19
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,204
Search out every corner.

20
00:02:25,742 --> 00:02:29,795
Damn stink bugs!

21
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,523
Hey, here! I got it!

22
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:33,941
Really? You got it?

23
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:35,860
Yeah, you're getting it too?

24
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:38,612
This one, 'coffee land 2G.'

25
00:02:38,713 --> 00:02:40,698
A new cafe opened up nearby?

26
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,408
Why can't I get it?

27
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,118
Come up here closer.

28
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:45,519
Hey kids?

29
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,913
- Is it working?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:50,566
Then check on Ka-Talk.

31
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:53,443
Pizza Time said they'd contact me.

32
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,362
Ok, hold on.

33
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:58,240
Here it is. Pizza Time.

34
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:05,014
Wow, check this out!

35
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:08,309
At this speed, I think
we can finish all these today!

36
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,643
We're getting paid today, right?

37
00:03:09,744 --> 00:03:13,213
- She does it standing.
- She's a pro!

38
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:16,341
What's that? Fumigation?

39
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:19,487
They still do that kind of thing?

40
00:03:19,588 --> 00:03:20,529
Guess so.

41
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,405
Shut the window.

42
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:23,991
Leave it alone.
We'll get free indoor fumigation.

43
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:25,784
And get rid of the stink bugs.

44
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:28,770
Right, too many stink bugs these days.

45
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:33,191
Oh, that smell!

46
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:37,463
I told you to shut it!

47
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:39,656
Should I shut it?

48
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:52,294
What's the problem exactly?

49
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,148
For example, have a look here.

50
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,592
You see this god-awful line?

51
00:03:59,127 --> 00:04:00,986
And why is there a crease here? Huh?

52
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:02,738
Why is this sticking out?

53
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:05,432
That means you didn't finish folding it.

54
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:10,246
On inspection, 1 out of 4 were in this condition.

55
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:12,898
Roughly, 1 out of 4 are rejects.

56
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:19,947
So, you're really docking 10% off our pay?

57
00:04:20,273 --> 00:04:23,951
Considering the fail rate,
the penalty is very minor, don't you think?

58
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:28,080
But, our pay is so low already!
Aren't you being too harsh?

59
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:31,116
You look here.

60
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:34,019
This is not a minor issue.

61
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,548
Do you know how much damage
these faulty boxes cause to our brand image?

62
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:42,812
Brand? You don't even have
a proper box folder, shit!

63
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:44,055
What did you say?!

64
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,440
Boss.

65
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:48,659
This is all because of that guy, isn't it?

66
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,618
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:53,581
That other part-time help,
he went AWOL, right?

68
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:56,792
Just when you got that huge, important
group order from that church.

69
00:04:56,893 --> 00:05:00,028
How do you know these details?

70
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:01,755
Who told you?

71
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:03,841
My sister knows the guy.

72
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:08,470
He's always been a bit strange.
He has a bad reputation around here.

73
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:10,664
Therefore, Boss.

74
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,225
The 10% penalty,
we'll accept it.

75
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:14,310
In return...

76
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:15,752
In return?

77
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:18,397
Any thought of hiring
new part-time help?

78
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:21,883
Sis, we need more hired help!

79
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:25,846
Fire that other part-timer.
Hand him the termination penalty.

80
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:29,998
I'll come for the formal interview tomorrow.
What time works best best for you?

81
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:31,393
Hold on a minute.

82
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:34,271
I need to think about this.

83
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:38,773
Then, let's start with the
payment for these boxes.

84
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,079
So we've all gathered here today...

85
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:51,722
to celebrate the partial
reconnection of our phones

86
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:55,643
and the bountiful Wi-Fi!

87
00:05:55,744 --> 00:05:59,296
That bastard !
So early in the evening!

88
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:03,525
Why haven't you put up the
'No Urinating' sign?

89
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:04,276
I told you to!

90
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:08,764
No, a sign like that only encourages
them...those drunkards.

91
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:11,075
At least yell at him!

92
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,809
No, don't shout.

93
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:15,062
"Please don't piss!"
Fuck!

94
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:19,691
Huh?
Is that Min-hyuk oppa?

95
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:22,294
Mister, what are you doing?
That's not the toilet.

96
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:23,712
That is Min-hyuk.

97
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:25,881
Hey, punk!

98
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:29,201
What... what are you staring at?

99
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,871
Come over here, you little shit.

100
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:36,958
Get a fucking grip!

101
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:40,020
Your friend has spunk!

102
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:43,190
University students have
real spirit. Spirit!

103
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,233
Unlike you, big brother.

104
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:47,736
But, is he coming here?
Were you expecting him?

105
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:48,937
No.

106
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:50,072
Hello!

107
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:51,807
Min-hyuk, you've come!

108
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,950
Hey, what's up?

109
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:53,826
Have you been well, sir?

110
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:56,620
- Of course.
- Hey, what's the ocassion?

111
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:58,313
I texted you.
You didn't see it?

112
00:06:58,848 --> 00:06:59,915
So sorry... during your meal.

113
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,211
No, no, we weren't eating.

114
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:03,585
- You've been well, Ki-jung?
- Yeah, and you?

115
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:06,422
You should've asked to meet up.
Why come all the way here?

116
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:07,256
Because of this.

117
00:07:07,357 --> 00:07:10,217
This is for you,
but it's so darn heavy.

118
00:07:10,318 --> 00:07:12,619
Really? Put it down here.

119
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:16,265
Wow, what is this?

120
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:17,933
I told my grandfather that
I'm seeing Ki-woo

121
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:21,294
and he insisted that
I take this to him.

122
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:28,009
Wow, is this an artscape stone?

123
00:07:29,128 --> 00:07:30,988
You can also
call this a zen stone.

124
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,781
Wow, you know!

125
00:07:32,882 --> 00:07:36,910
My grandpa has collected these stones
since his military academy days.

126
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:40,539
Now downstairs, upstairs,
living room, the study...

127
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,624
they're all filled with these.

128
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:46,587
This stone is said to bring material fortune
and promotion to the family...

129
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:48,029
Hey, Min-hyuk!

130
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:51,300
This is really symbolic!

131
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:54,720
For sure! Truly, this is very timely.

132
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:55,512
Isn't it?

133
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:59,666
Please relay our deepest
gratitude to your grandfather.

134
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:01,960
You could've brought
something to eat.

135
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:14,907
Hey, what was that called?
Artscape stone?

136
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:16,325
You collect those rocks too?

137
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:22,392
Hey, thanks to that rock, I got to
see your parents. They looked healthy.

138
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:26,692
They're plenty healthy,
just out of work.

139
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:32,178
Is Ki-jung also home bound these days?
Not taking classes?

140
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:36,462
It's not that she doesn't want to.
It's that she can't.

141
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:45,587
She's cute, huh?

142
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:48,774
Wow, is that her?
The one you're tutoring?

143
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,318
Park Da-hye.
High school sophomore.

144
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:54,804
Why don't you take my place
as her English tutor?

145
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:56,073
What are you talking about?

146
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:58,683
It's tutoring for a rich family.
They pay very well.

147
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:00,828
And, she's a good kid.

148
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:04,314
While I'm studying abroad,
take good care of her.

149
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:08,210
What about your close
university friends?

150
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:11,905
Why ask a deadbeat like me?

151
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,782
Why do you think?

152
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:16,426
Even the thought of it makes me sick.

153
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:20,681
My wolf-like bastard classmates
fawning all over Da-hye?

154
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:23,124
It's revolting.

155
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:30,131
You into her?

156
00:09:35,171 --> 00:09:37,347
Hey, I'm serious.

157
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:42,769
Year after next, when she enters university,
I'm going to officially ask her out.

158
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:44,663
Until then, take good care of her.

159
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:49,276
If it's you, I can leave with trust.

160
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:53,488
Thanks for trusting me, but...

161
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:57,450
do you want me to
pretend I'm a university student?

162
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:01,955
Ki-woo, think about it.

163
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,893
Two years before and after
your military service

164
00:10:05,994 --> 00:10:08,312
you took the university entrance exam 4 times.

165
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:11,464
Grammar, vocabulary,
composition, conversation...

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,483
Honestly, when it comes to English

167
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:17,929
you can teach it 10 times better than those
alcohol binging college pricks.

168
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:22,058
- I guess so.
- Sure!

169
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:25,913
But, will that family accept me?
I'm not even a university student.

170
00:10:26,014 --> 00:10:27,539
We'll just BS a little.

171
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,776
It'll be alright! First of all,
you're going on my recommendation, and...

172
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:35,488
how should I describe her mother...?

173
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:38,926
The madame's a bit simple.

174
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:40,177
Young and simple.

175
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:41,411
Simple?

176
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:43,347
What do you mean?

177
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:47,709
I don't know... Anyway, all's good.
It's been good for me.

178
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:49,228
So you're doing this, ok?

179
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:51,129
Ok, then.

180
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:56,068
Hey, I hear Ki-jung is very
talented with her hands.

181
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:00,364
...good with things like Photoshop.

182
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:04,576
With skills like this, why are you
rejected to art schools every time?

183
00:11:04,677 --> 00:11:06,311
Wanna die?

184
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:10,624
Excuse me, it's non-smoking here.

185
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:12,125
Yeah, sure. Give me that.

186
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:13,401
Ok.

187
00:11:17,732 --> 00:11:20,700
Now the finishing touch ...in scarlet red.

188
00:11:22,236 --> 00:11:26,640
Wow, I wonder if Seoul National University
has a major in document forgery.

189
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:30,102
Ki-jung would be admitted
top of her class!

190
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:32,896
So true, huh?
Her skills!

191
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:38,510
Our boy's going for a job interview and
no words of encouragement?

192
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:40,145
Son!

193
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:44,057
I'm proud of you.

194
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:45,275
Father!

195
00:11:46,177 --> 00:11:49,413
I don't think of this
as forgery or crime.

196
00:11:49,514 --> 00:11:51,498
Because, for sure, I'm going to
this university next year.

197
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:55,085
So, you've got a plan!

198
00:11:55,186 --> 00:11:59,364
I think of it as having produced
this document just earlier.

199
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:29,364
<b>Subtitle | www.movieddl.me</b>

200
00:12:34,517 --> 00:12:35,817
Who is it?

201
00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:38,170
Are you... Da-hye's mother?
How do you do?

202
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,047
I'm here on teacher
Min-hyuk's recommendation.

203
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:42,282
Oh, right.
Come on in.

204
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:44,417
Thank you.

205
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,609
Hello!

206
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:19,753
How do you do, Madame?

207
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:23,281
I'm just someone who
works here. Come this way.

208
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:25,425
The garden is so nice.

209
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:27,160
The interior is nice, too.

210
00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:30,980
You know the architect
Nam-goong? He's very famous.

211
00:13:31,081 --> 00:13:33,792
This is the house
that he lived in.

212
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:38,171
He built all this himself.

213
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:46,179
Now... as you can see,
this is just a family home with children.

214
00:13:46,714 --> 00:13:47,814
This way.

215
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:52,585
Please sit here and wait.
I'll bring her right up.

216
00:13:52,686 --> 00:13:53,786
Yes.

217
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:13,576
Madame?

218
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:16,501
Madame?

219
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,465
He's here.
The tutoring candidate.

220
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:28,221
I don't need documents like these.

221
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:31,307
You're here on teacher Min-hyuk's
recommendation, anyway.

222
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:38,064
As you must know, teacher Min-hyuk
is such a "brilliant" person.

223
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:40,834
Da-hye and my satisfaction with teacher
Min-hyuk was very high.

224
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:44,171
...independent of her grades.
Do you know what I mean?

225
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:45,372
Yes.

226
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:47,549
Things were very good.

227
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:55,089
Honestly, Da-hye and I wanted to stick with him
until her university exam next year.

228
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:58,751
But, suddenly he tells us
he's leaving to study abroad.

229
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:06,401
So, excuse me for being blunt,
but... honestly

230
00:15:06,502 --> 00:15:11,323
if you're not up to teacher
Min-hyuk's level, then...

231
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:13,850
there's really no point.

232
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:19,623
So, anyway, what I wanted to say is...

233
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:25,378
for your first lesson today,
would you mind if I sat in?

234
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:29,449
I want to see it "full time"
to see how you run your lessons.

235
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:33,578
Is it okay with you?

236
00:16:01,724 --> 00:16:03,524
Are you sure about #24?

237
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:16,179
You just spent a long while solving those
problems before going back to #24.

238
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,955
Right?

239
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:20,833
Yes.

240
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:33,930
If this was the actual exam and this the first question,
you'd be screwed from the beginning.

241
00:16:34,465 --> 00:16:38,101
Look at this. Your pulse is
pitter-pattering all over the place.

242
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:44,065
The heart cannot lie.

243
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:48,169
What is an exam, exactly?
It's all about cutting through.

244
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,114
The flow! Lose that rhythm
and you're finished.

245
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:53,633
The correct answer to #24?
I'm not interested.

246
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:59,122
How you punch through the entire exam...
How you dominate it

247
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:01,540
that's what I'm interested in.

248
00:17:02,576 --> 00:17:06,295
In real battle, it's all about the spirit.

249
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:08,756
Spirit.

250
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:11,259
Understand?

251
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:25,081
Your salary will be paid out
about this time every month

252
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:28,359
Lessons every Mon/Wed/Fri.
2 hours each. Is that okay?

253
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:30,211
As for the amount...

254
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:34,049
I was going to match teacher Min-hyuk's
rate but adjusted it for inflation.

255
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,700
Thank you.

256
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:39,220
How about a proper introduction?

257
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:42,248
Da-hye's English tutor.
We'll call him teacher Kevin.

258
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,625
Teacher Kevin!

259
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:48,521
If you get hungry during your lessons,
let me know anytime.

260
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:50,690
If you need anything, just ask her.

261
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,384
She's the house expert, more than me!
She knows every nook and cranny...

262
00:17:53,544 --> 00:17:56,971
Da-song ! Watch the head!

263
00:17:57,782 --> 00:17:58,782
I'm so sorry! He startled you?

264
00:17:58,883 --> 00:18:01,326
So, cute. Da-song?

265
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,244
Yes, our youngest.

266
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:04,871
Da-song, come say hi!

267
00:18:04,972 --> 00:18:06,689
This is teacher Kevin!

268
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:13,296
This is an Indian arrow.
We ordered it directly from a U.S. website.

269
00:18:13,397 --> 00:18:16,699
He's been fanatic about
Indians since last year.

270
00:18:18,736 --> 00:18:19,836
Indians?

271
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:23,139
He seems to have mania traits.

272
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,810
Well, he's just so aloof
and easily distracted.

273
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:29,712
He can hardly sit still!

274
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:32,023
So, last year I enrolled him
in Cub Scouts...

275
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:35,068
hoping he'd learn some
restraint and focus.

276
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:36,677
But, look at him.

277
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:38,888
He came back worse!

278
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:46,562
Not sure if he was influenced by his
Cub Scout teacher who is crazy about Indians.

279
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:51,292
The very spirit of Cub Scouts originates
from the native American Indians.

280
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:52,335
That's a good thing!

281
00:18:52,436 --> 00:18:55,547
Teacher Kevin,
you were a Cub Scout, too?

282
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:58,842
Yes, I'm a total Scout
by disposition.

283
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:03,329
Our Da-song is a total artist by
disposition. Have a look.

284
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:07,142
This is really symbolic.
It's very intense!

285
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:08,893
Intense, right?

286
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:11,295
Of course, you are very insightful.

287
00:19:12,414 --> 00:19:13,898
That's a drawing of
a chimpanzee, right?

288
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:15,758
It's a self-portrait.

289
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:20,596
Sure enough!

290
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:24,868
From the perspective of grown-ups
Da-song's expressive genius

291
00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:27,412
eludes their understanding.

292
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:32,959
Maybe that's why we've been through
so many art teachers.

293
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,319
And none of them could last
more than a month.

294
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:39,949
And also, Da-song is
so difficult to control.

295
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:44,954
- Madame?
- Yes?

296
00:19:45,489 --> 00:19:48,875
Someone just came to mind.

297
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,918
What was her name?

298
00:19:51,453 --> 00:19:53,938
Jessica! Right, Jessica...

299
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:58,342
Among the junior classmates of my cousin
is someone named Jessica.

300
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,029
What was her Korean name?

301
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:06,159
Anyway, after studying applied arts at the
Illinois State University

302
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,161
she just returned to Korea.

303
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:10,705
Illinois... and?

304
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:17,584
Jessica has a reputation for her unconventional
teaching style and command over children.

305
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,573
...a very fresh approach in this field.

306
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:23,301
But, even with her
unconventional methods...

307
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:25,678
Her students get in to the best art schools
- from middle school to university.

308
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:29,916
Oh my... I'm very curious.
What is she like?

309
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:32,043
Would you like to meet her?

310
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:35,463
But, I hear it's very hard
to get an appointment with her.

311
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:42,553
Hold it.

312
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:47,659
Jessica, Only child, Illinois, Chicago

313
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,978
Senior classmate Kim Jin-mo,
Second cousin.

314
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,881
Look how he's stained the table cloth
with drippings of banchan, gochujang and rice

315
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:04,384
in this mosaic-like arrangement.

316
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:07,178
These have repeating patterns, too.

317
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,557
Gochujang is red, grains of the rice.
Well, anyway...

318
00:21:10,658 --> 00:21:15,670
He's showing his Basquiat-esque feel.
And he's only 9 year old!

319
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:17,772
Hmm... you've piqued my interest.

320
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:23,010
Since I'm sure teacher Jessica gets all this

321
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:27,181
I'll leave you two to continue
and I will start my lesson with Da-hye.

322
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,409
Teacher Jessica, see you next time.

323
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,477
Yes, thank you.

324
00:21:35,516 --> 00:21:41,028
So if you see over there, shall we say...
Da-song's eccentric disposition?

325
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:44,665
Da-hye.

326
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:48,411
Shall we start with question #38?

327
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,975
Teacher.

328
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:55,293
Yeah?

329
00:21:55,411 --> 00:22:00,673
Did you know that with
Da-song... it's all a pretense?

330
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,401
Huh? What do you mean?

331
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:05,194
It's all a show. A show!

332
00:22:05,295 --> 00:22:09,032
Acting all genius, that 4th dimension
stuff - it's all a pretense.

333
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:10,766
An artist cosplay.

334
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:12,560
Da-song?

335
00:22:14,096 --> 00:22:15,330
You know that thing...

336
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:20,230
when someone stops in his tracks and looks up
as if stricken with some random inspiration?

337
00:22:20,352 --> 00:22:26,115
Like when someone stops to stare at the
clouds for 10 minutes... stuff like that?

338
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,301
You do know!

339
00:22:28,402 --> 00:22:30,970
He gives me the goose bumps!

340
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:34,498
He pretends that everyday life
gets him down.

341
00:22:35,034 --> 00:22:36,351
Makes me want to puke, really.

342
00:22:36,452 --> 00:22:39,628
So, Da-song is like that.

343
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:44,383
But, what's that got to do with
you solving those problems?

344
00:22:48,422 --> 00:22:52,099
I mean... well, I'm just saying.

345
00:22:54,636 --> 00:22:56,604
Ok then, with that in mind...

346
00:22:57,681 --> 00:23:02,026
What you just expressed about
Da-song was very interesting.

347
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:04,403
So, let's try some
English composition.

348
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:10,618
Only, be sure to use the word
"pretend" at least twice.

349
00:23:11,153 --> 00:23:14,097
Then, can I ask you a question?

350
00:23:14,198 --> 00:23:15,264
Sure.

351
00:23:15,365 --> 00:23:17,833
That teacher Jessica.

352
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:25,466
Is she really your cousin's junior classmate?

353
00:23:27,002 --> 00:23:28,569
What do you mean?

354
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,055
She's your girlfriend, right?

355
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:38,187
No, I met her today for the first time!

356
00:23:42,226 --> 00:23:45,236
Teacher Jessica was
really pretty, wasn't she?

357
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:47,947
You don't find her attractive?

358
00:23:48,982 --> 00:23:50,591
You saw her earlier?

359
00:23:50,692 --> 00:23:55,096
Sure, she's pretty.
You can say she's attractive.

360
00:23:55,197 --> 00:23:56,297
Yeah.

361
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,710
I knew it!

362
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:04,505
You are interested in her.

363
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:08,676
Da-hye...

364
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:17,535
If we had to use the rose metaphor
for teacher Jessica

365
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:19,186
then, Da-hye, you are...

366
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:06,626
- Let's solve the problem.
- Ok.

367
00:25:06,727 --> 00:25:12,090
Please understand that my boy
has trouble keeping still.

368
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:13,699
I understand.

369
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:15,334
Da-song!

370
00:25:16,095 --> 00:25:17,095
Da-song, get up!

371
00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:18,913
Come on, Da-song!

372
00:25:19,807 --> 00:25:20,807
It's in your butt!

373
00:25:20,908 --> 00:25:23,810
- Mrs. Park, please leave us.
- What?

374
00:25:23,911 --> 00:25:26,253
I never teach with parents in the room.

375
00:25:26,788 --> 00:25:29,107
But today is our first day,
and as you can see, he's...

376
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,258
Please wait downstairs.

377
00:25:32,736 --> 00:25:33,736
Park Da-song?

378
00:25:33,837 --> 00:25:35,054
Da-song!

379
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:40,518
- Madame?
- Huh?

380
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:42,870
Would you like some
plum vinegar drink?

381
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:43,955
Whah?

382
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:47,375
Mixed with some honey
...to ease your tension.

383
00:25:47,476 --> 00:25:49,902
Yeah, that would be great.

384
00:26:04,451 --> 00:26:06,210
- Over here!
- Yes?

385
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:07,854
We can do it this way.

386
00:26:07,955 --> 00:26:11,215
Mix two glasses and
take it up to Da-song's room.

387
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,485
You're not a parent,
so you can go in!

388
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:16,028
Oh, that's right!

389
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:18,990
Then I'll report back on
how they're doing in there...

390
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:21,809
I should've done this earlier!

391
00:26:24,076 --> 00:26:25,176
What is it?

392
00:26:25,347 --> 00:26:26,831
Are they out?

393
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:28,482
Yeah.

394
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:33,779
So, you're finished already?

395
00:26:35,315 --> 00:26:36,615
Mrs. Park?

396
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,118
Please come and sit next to me.

397
00:26:41,154 --> 00:26:42,788
Da-song, you wait upstairs.

398
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:45,925
Hurry it up!

399
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:54,442
Da-song just drew this.

400
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:55,968
I see...

401
00:26:57,504 --> 00:26:59,989
I want to speak with Mrs. Park alone.

402
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,240
Oh, but she's our...

403
00:27:01,341 --> 00:27:04,310
No, please excuse us.

404
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:14,587
Mrs. Park, I told you earlier that I'm doing advanced
studies in art psychology and art therapy?

405
00:27:14,688 --> 00:27:15,863
Yes, yes.

406
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:19,408
Did something happen to
Da-song in the first grade?

407
00:27:21,945 --> 00:27:24,413
To be honest,

408
00:27:24,948 --> 00:27:27,934
before deciding whether
I can take on Da-song,

409
00:27:28,035 --> 00:27:30,794
I will need to know more about this.

410
00:27:30,912 --> 00:27:34,907
But, so sudden to talk
about this right now...

411
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:35,858
What to do?

412
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:37,634
It's alright, then.

413
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:43,115
Normally, the lower-right region of a drawing
is called the "schizophrenia zone."

414
00:27:43,216 --> 00:27:45,701
Psychotic symptoms
often reveal themselves here.

415
00:27:45,802 --> 00:27:46,702
Oh, phrenia...

416
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:47,787
Look here.

417
00:27:47,888 --> 00:27:50,456
Da-song drew these
unusual shapes, right?

418
00:27:50,557 --> 00:27:51,774
I see.

419
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:56,671
Over there, it's the same!
It's the same, right?

420
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:58,947
Yes, that's correct.

421
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:02,760
Similar shapes in the same zone.
Do you see it now?

422
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:04,119
Yes.

423
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:08,975
I saw that drawing every day
...at every meal.

424
00:28:09,076 --> 00:28:11,227
But, I had absolutely no idea!

425
00:28:11,328 --> 00:28:14,463
Please calm down. Keep calm!

426
00:28:14,998 --> 00:28:18,008
This is all a black box
into Da-song's mind.

427
00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:22,304
Would you like to open that
black box with me, Mrs. Park?

428
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,573
I want to open it, teacher.

429
00:28:24,674 --> 00:28:29,078
Then, Mon/Tue/Thus/Fri.
2-hour sessions every week.

430
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:33,416
And this is not your basic tutoring,
but more art therapy, right?

431
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:34,375
Of course.

432
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:38,362
Therefore, my rate will need to be
considerably higher.

433
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:39,964
Are you okay with that?

434
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:41,740
I'm more thankful for it!

435
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:44,993
Oh my, that must be Da-song's dad.

436
00:28:51,535 --> 00:28:55,712
Honey, Da-song's new art teacher is here.

437
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,551
Her name's teacher Jessica,
from Illinois.

438
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:03,095
Jessica ! This is Dong-ik.

439
00:29:03,255 --> 00:29:05,031
- How do you do?
- Oh, hi.

440
00:29:05,132 --> 00:29:06,974
Please take good care of Da-song.

441
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:08,409
Is the lesson over?

442
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,610
Yes, just finished.

443
00:29:10,037 --> 00:29:11,037
- Driver Yoon.
- Yes?

444
00:29:11,138 --> 00:29:12,705
- Are you ok with time?
- Yes, I'm ok.

445
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:15,374
Why not give the teacher a lift home?

446
00:29:15,475 --> 00:29:19,920
Sure, we don't want her walking down
alone at night, right?

447
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:21,280
Of course.

448
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:22,823
Teacher Jessica?

449
00:29:23,358 --> 00:29:28,871
Since you're already in the car,
may I drive you all the way home?

450
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:32,266
- Which neighborhood?
- No. that's fine

451
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:36,170
You can just drop me off
at the Hyehwa station.

452
00:29:36,313 --> 00:29:37,313
Thank you.

453
00:29:37,414 --> 00:29:38,689
I don't mind if your home is far.

454
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,985
- My shift is finished, anyway.
- I'll just get off at the Hyehwa station.

455
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:46,513
...looks like it's going to rain.

456
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:50,284
Forget the subway, let's go all the way
in this Mercedes Benz.

457
00:29:50,385 --> 00:29:53,854
I'm supposed to meet my boyfriend
at the Hyehwa station, exit #3.

458
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,490
I see.

459
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:35,270
Dad, did you drive a lot of Mercedes Benzes
when you worked as a designated driver?

460
00:30:35,805 --> 00:30:42,152
Mercedes Benzes? Not then, but I did a lot
when I worked as a valet in Daechi-dong.

461
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:45,172
Oh right, you worked as a valet!

462
00:30:45,273 --> 00:30:49,009
After our fried chicken business went bust, and
before the opening of our Taiwanese castella bakery.

463
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,928
In that 6-month window?

464
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:54,831
No, it was after our
castella bakery went bust.

465
00:30:57,452 --> 00:30:59,628
Then, we're moving ahead with it?

466
00:31:00,163 --> 00:31:03,774
I finished setting up the
Mercedes Benz S-class already.

467
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:05,759
Then, we are moving ahead with it.

468
00:31:06,294 --> 00:31:08,195
Wow, it's so symbolic here.

469
00:31:08,296 --> 00:31:11,682
Look Father, we're eating in a
drivers' cafeteria, of all places.

470
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:14,476
Indeed, a drivers' cafeteria!

471
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:16,871
Eat as much as you want
there's plenty!

472
00:31:16,972 --> 00:31:19,898
Why are you being so generous?
Kids are the ones buying!

473
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:23,043
My son, have some more. Eat up!

474
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:23,961
Yes, sir.

475
00:31:24,062 --> 00:31:25,087
Eat your fill!

476
00:31:25,188 --> 00:31:27,423
What did you do to Mrs. Park yesterday?

477
00:31:27,524 --> 00:31:28,174
What?

478
00:31:28,275 --> 00:31:29,967
She was freaking out!

479
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:32,411
Saying she was so moved and stuff.

480
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:33,888
Fuck, I don't know!

481
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:37,874
I researched art therapy
on the internet and BS'd a little.

482
00:31:37,993 --> 00:31:40,561
Suddenly, she started weeping!

483
00:31:40,662 --> 00:31:43,046
Crazy bitch.
I couldn't believe it!

484
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:18,682
Oh, you're home, Honey?

485
00:32:18,783 --> 00:32:20,500
Did you have dinner?

486
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:23,771
Why, is something wrong?

487
00:32:23,872 --> 00:32:25,189
Is the housekeeper out?

488
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,341
She's walking the dogs.

489
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:29,343
Honey.

490
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:32,596
This was under my car seat.

491
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,351
Driver Yoon, you crazy bastard.

492
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,810
What is this?

493
00:32:39,846 --> 00:32:41,080
I'm so sorry, honey.

494
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:43,290
I didn't know driver Yoon
was this kind of person.

495
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:46,485
Don't you pay him very well?

496
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,005
Is this bastard skimping
motel costs so he can save up?

497
00:32:50,106 --> 00:32:51,548
He must be a pervert.

498
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:52,925
He likes it in the car
better than motels.

499
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:56,929
Oh, that's disgusting.
How in his own boss' car!

500
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:01,667
A young guy's sex life is his
private business. That's all fine.

501
00:33:05,205 --> 00:33:07,714
But of all places,
why in my car?

502
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,778
And if so, why not in his own front seat?
Why cross the line like that?

503
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:14,429
You're right.

504
00:33:14,964 --> 00:33:17,866
Does dripping his semen
all over my seat turn him on?

505
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:20,143
You're right.

506
00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:28,860
But, you know what's
strangest of all?

507
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:30,737
What?

508
00:33:31,773 --> 00:33:34,091
If you have car sex

509
00:33:34,192 --> 00:33:39,471
one might leave behind
a strand of hair, or an earring.

510
00:33:39,572 --> 00:33:40,681
Right.

511
00:33:40,782 --> 00:33:44,626
But how can you forget
your own panties?

512
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:49,047
So, true!
It's a hard thing to forget!

513
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:54,344
So, this raises suspicions
about this woman.

514
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,596
Are you getting this?

515
00:34:06,182 --> 00:34:07,750
Oh my... like meth or cocaine?!

516
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:09,568
Shhh!
The kids...

517
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:11,295
What do we do?

518
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:14,048
What if anyone finds something
like white powder in your car?

519
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:16,742
Calm down, relax!

520
00:34:17,277 --> 00:34:18,784
Relax.

521
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,621
For now it's just a supposition.
A reasonable suspicion.

522
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:24,808
But, nothing to call the police about.

523
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:26,752
Of course, not.

524
00:34:27,328 --> 00:34:33,108
Silly for a busy guy like me to reprimand,
"Why are you banging someone in my car?"

525
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,318
That would be silly.

526
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:36,235
So instead...

527
00:34:36,337 --> 00:34:41,367
Can you make up some harmless excuse
and let him go quietly?

528
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:42,826
Okay, sure.

529
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:46,288
No need to mention panties or car sex.

530
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:48,374
We don't need to stoop
down to that level, do we?

531
00:34:48,475 --> 00:34:50,484
Surely not!

532
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:53,879
But, do you think driver Yoon might go online
to accuse us of wrongful termination?

533
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,989
Give him a good severance package...

534
00:34:56,524 --> 00:34:59,802
You're fininshed?
Did Da-song do well today?

535
00:34:59,903 --> 00:35:01,995
Yes, of course.

536
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,640
- So, lesson is finished?
- Yes.

537
00:35:04,741 --> 00:35:07,309
Teacher, the last time you came,

538
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,853
our driver gave you a ride, right?

539
00:35:09,954 --> 00:35:10,813
That's right.

540
00:35:10,914 --> 00:35:13,273
This may be an awkward question,

541
00:35:13,374 --> 00:35:15,258
but nothing happened then?

542
00:35:15,376 --> 00:35:16,735
He was very friendly.

543
00:35:16,836 --> 00:35:18,696
I asked him to just drop
me off at the Hyehwa station.

544
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:22,074
But, he kept insisting to
take me all the way home.

545
00:35:22,175 --> 00:35:25,327
That jerk, he drove all the way to
your home, so late at night?

546
00:35:25,428 --> 00:35:27,104
To reveal where you live?

547
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:30,416
No, I got off at the Hyehwa station.

548
00:35:30,517 --> 00:35:32,876
Oh, you did well.
You did very well.

549
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:34,545
Jessica, nice!

550
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:37,005
Did something happen with him?

551
00:35:37,106 --> 00:35:42,302
He won't be working for us anymore.
A slightly shameful incident.

552
00:35:42,403 --> 00:35:44,346
What kind of incident?

553
00:35:44,447 --> 00:35:47,415
Teacher, enough about that.

554
00:35:48,952 --> 00:35:52,563
But I'm surprised. He was
so gentlemanly and cool.

555
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:55,983
Jessica, you're
too young and innocent!

556
00:35:56,084 --> 00:35:58,176
You haven't experienced
a lot of people.

557
00:35:59,212 --> 00:36:03,782
But, at the time, we were excited
to have such a young, hip driver.

558
00:36:03,883 --> 00:36:07,077
But aren't drivers
better when a bit older?

559
00:36:07,178 --> 00:36:11,165
That's true! They drive better
and have better manners.

560
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:13,917
The driver who worked for my uncle
was just like that.

561
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:18,464
Driver Kim -- he was
so congenial and nice.

562
00:36:18,565 --> 00:36:21,091
I used to call him 'uncle' too,
when I was young.

563
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:23,177
You know a man like that?

564
00:36:23,278 --> 00:36:26,329
Yes, he was so mild-mannered.

565
00:36:26,865 --> 00:36:31,626
Right! My uncle recently
transferred to Chicago.

566
00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:34,897
I wonder if he's currently
available.

567
00:36:34,998 --> 00:36:38,984
Very interesting !
Could I meet him, maybe?

568
00:36:39,085 --> 00:36:40,152
Oh, really?

569
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:42,637
Nowadays, I can't trust people.

570
00:36:43,172 --> 00:36:46,074
If not recommended by someone
I know well, I really can't trust anyone.

571
00:36:46,175 --> 00:36:50,854
But, if he's some one you've seen
since you were young, that's reassuring.

572
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:55,483
Do you really want to meet him?

573
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:57,527
I'm deadly serious.

574
00:36:58,062 --> 00:37:01,615
Networking through
trusted referrals seems best.

575
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,366
How shall I describe it?

576
00:37:03,526 --> 00:37:04,951
Safety belt of trust?

577
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,470
- This one's different.
- Here.

578
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:07,137
Oh, right.

579
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:08,872
And this one.

580
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,516
Looks like a touch screen now.

581
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:13,519
That's not touch.
It says you have to turn it.

582
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,670
Wow, this thing?

583
00:37:16,105 --> 00:37:17,105
Sir?

584
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:19,549
You're taking your time?

585
00:37:22,147 --> 00:37:23,976
This is a nice car.

586
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:28,141
Here it is!
Come over here.

587
00:37:31,846 --> 00:37:33,396
He's in a meeting now.

588
00:37:38,436 --> 00:37:40,445
Have a seat and wait here.

589
00:37:49,072 --> 00:37:52,540
How do you do?
Nice to meet...

590
00:37:55,662 --> 00:37:57,145
But, is it compatible
with mobile phones?

591
00:37:57,246 --> 00:38:03,927
These are not compatible.
Requires more computing power.

592
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:09,683
This isn't a test drive or anything,
so don't be nervous.

593
00:38:10,426 --> 00:38:13,478
I came out because I felt
so couped up at the office all day.

594
00:38:14,013 --> 00:38:15,163
I understand.

595
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:19,859
Constant chatter, all that bother.
At least, the car should offer some peace.

596
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:23,571
Thank you.

597
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:25,799
You seem to know the roads very well?

598
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,219
Below the 38th parallel, I know
all the roads and side streets.

599
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,580
It comes naturally
after 30 years behind the wheel.

600
00:38:33,116 --> 00:38:35,750
I respect those who work
in a single field for a long time.

601
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:38,979
Well, to be honest
this may be a simple vocation.

602
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,090
But, to get on the road every morning
with the head of a household

603
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:43,775
or with the company's
commander-in-chief

604
00:38:43,876 --> 00:38:49,389
or with just a solitary man
each and every morning...

605
00:38:50,258 --> 00:38:52,017
it's a companionship of a sort.

606
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:55,078
So, that's been my approach
each and every day.

607
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:57,063
The years sure pass quickly.

608
00:39:00,768 --> 00:39:03,403
Sure enough,
your cornering is superb.

609
00:39:04,105 --> 00:39:10,469
Well, the fundamentals
may look easy, but...

610
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:15,332
May look sheepish, but
inside she's a crafty old fox.

611
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,543
Sometimes she acts like
she owns the house!

612
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:20,062
Right.

613
00:39:20,163 --> 00:39:24,650
She's lived there longer
than anyone in that house.

614
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:28,403
She was the housekeeper
to that architect, Nam-goong.

615
00:39:28,504 --> 00:39:33,183
But then, she stayed on
to work for this family.

616
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:35,077
When Mr. Nam-goong moved out,

617
00:39:35,178 --> 00:39:38,080
he introduced that woman to
Mr. and Mrs. Park, telling them...

618
00:39:38,181 --> 00:39:41,524
"She takes great care of this house.
You should keep her!"

619
00:39:41,642 --> 00:39:44,962
So, this is the case where the house ownership
changed, but not the housekeeper.

620
00:39:45,063 --> 00:39:48,114
She's holding tight to this good job
and not letting go.

621
00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:51,785
To surgically remove a woman like that,
we need some preparation.

622
00:39:53,488 --> 00:39:55,830
Right, we need a plan.

623
00:39:56,866 --> 00:40:00,418
I want some peaches.
I like peaches best.

624
00:40:00,953 --> 00:40:02,062
Why not ask for some?

625
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:05,924
No peaches allowed in our home
- - forbidden fruit.

626
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:16,451
According to what
I heard from Da-hye,

627
00:40:16,552 --> 00:40:21,164
she has a massively
serious allergy to peaches.

628
00:40:21,265 --> 00:40:24,501
You know all that
fuzz on the skin?

629
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:28,213
If she goes anywhere near it,
she breaks out in hives

630
00:40:28,314 --> 00:40:32,283
has trouble breathing,
asthma, a total meltdown!

631
00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:40,959
No, no, no. No peaches anywhere
and it still happened.

632
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,088
That's what I'm saying!

633
00:40:45,331 --> 00:40:47,816
Usually when I get symptoms like this

634
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:51,319
I run to my room and
medication takes care of it.

635
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,783
This was so sudden, I panicked and
couldn't remember where I put it!

636
00:40:56,884 --> 00:41:01,913
Madame, this woman behind me,
is that...?

637
00:41:02,014 --> 00:41:03,915
Oh, my! That's our housekeeper!

638
00:41:04,016 --> 00:41:06,668
Then it's true!
Oh, what should I do?

639
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:09,755
I wasn't sure if that was really her.

640
00:41:09,856 --> 00:41:13,616
I've only seen her a couple of times
in the living room.

641
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:16,136
You took this in a hospital?

642
00:41:16,237 --> 00:41:20,165
A few days ago,
I went for my annual checkup.

643
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,711
I took a selfie for my wife,
and there she was, right behind me.

644
00:41:25,204 --> 00:41:27,213
She's talking to someone on the phone?

645
00:41:27,415 --> 00:41:32,569
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop...

646
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,488
but because I could hear her conversation!

647
00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:36,323
- I couldn't help but...
- Cut, cut!

648
00:41:36,424 --> 00:41:39,284
Father, your emotion is
too far up to here.

649
00:41:39,385 --> 00:41:41,644
Bring it down to about here.

650
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,623
I couldn't help but overhear.

651
00:41:44,724 --> 00:41:47,484
Compress it, then... boom!

652
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,296
What I'm trying to say is,
it's just that...

653
00:41:51,397 --> 00:41:55,617
her voice was quite loud!

654
00:41:55,776 --> 00:41:59,304
It's alright.
Just tell me, okay?

655
00:41:59,405 --> 00:42:02,224
She said she just got
diagnosed with Active TB.

656
00:42:02,325 --> 00:42:04,392
And was shouting
about it on the phone

657
00:42:04,493 --> 00:42:07,562
as if so upset with herself,
she could hardly control herself!

658
00:42:07,663 --> 00:42:09,981
Tuberculosis? Surely...

659
00:42:10,082 --> 00:42:15,428
It's true! She was telling someone
on the phone that she had Active TB.

660
00:42:15,963 --> 00:42:20,558
"Oh my! Do people still get TB these days?"
Oh my! Do people still get TB these days?

661
00:42:20,752 --> 00:42:21,852
"Dad : "

662
00:42:22,094 --> 00:42:27,082
"True... in the old days, people
used to buy Christmas seals for this."

663
00:42:27,183 --> 00:42:28,500
"Feels like something from a bygone era..."

664
00:42:28,601 --> 00:42:30,252
Search it on the internet.

665
00:42:30,353 --> 00:42:34,172
Korea ranks # 1 for TB
among of all OECD countries.

666
00:42:34,273 --> 00:42:37,801
"She was working, pretending
as if nothing was wrong !"

667
00:42:37,902 --> 00:42:39,845
"With young children in the house
like Da-song."

668
00:42:39,946 --> 00:42:43,223
And, with young children
in the house like Da-song.

669
00:42:43,324 --> 00:42:46,560
A TB patient is doing dishes, preparing
food and coughing up bodily fluids...

670
00:42:46,661 --> 00:42:48,294
Stop it, please!

671
00:43:41,132 --> 00:43:45,143
If we get the chance,
this will be the finishing touch.

672
00:44:30,556 --> 00:44:32,148
- Have a seat
- Yes.

673
00:44:34,293 --> 00:44:35,293
Driver Kim.

674
00:44:35,394 --> 00:44:39,464
Please don't tell any of this
to my kids or my husband, okay?

675
00:44:39,565 --> 00:44:40,590
I understand.

676
00:44:40,691 --> 00:44:45,370
If he hears I've harboured
a TB patient in our home

677
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:48,265
I'll be hanged and quartered!

678
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:50,267
Don't worry, Madame.

679
00:44:50,368 --> 00:44:53,979
And if I may please say one thing

680
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,382
I have no hard feelings
against that woman.

681
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:05,006
I merely felt I had to speak up from
the perspective of public health and safety.

682
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:08,910
This could be misconstrued
as snitching...

683
00:45:09,011 --> 00:45:10,412
You don't have to worry about that.

684
00:45:10,513 --> 00:45:13,081
I'm not going to mention TB to her.

685
00:45:13,182 --> 00:45:15,625
I'll just make up some other
excuse and dismiss her.

686
00:45:15,726 --> 00:45:17,235
Simply and quietly.

687
00:45:18,854 --> 00:45:21,548
It's the proven way.
This is the best way.

688
00:45:21,649 --> 00:45:23,574
Well, then.

689
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:40,164
You...
washed your hands?

690
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:27,364
Driver Kim, do you know
a good braised-galbi place?

691
00:46:27,465 --> 00:46:29,115
Not too far away.
Somewhere near by?

692
00:46:29,216 --> 00:46:30,575
Sure.

693
00:46:30,676 --> 00:46:34,437
- Then you'll be eating out?
- That's right.

694
00:46:35,055 --> 00:46:37,982
Not sure why the craving
for braised-galbi today.

695
00:46:38,517 --> 00:46:41,402
Our housekeeper used to make
really good braised ribs.

696
00:46:42,438 --> 00:46:44,506
The one who quit
the day before yesterday?

697
00:46:44,607 --> 00:46:49,577
My wife wouldn't even tell me why she quit.

698
00:46:52,198 --> 00:46:57,585
Then again, housekeepers are plentiful.
We could just hire a new one.

699
00:46:58,621 --> 00:47:03,233
Still, it's a shame.
She was a very good housekeeper.

700
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:04,234
I see.

701
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:06,903
She kept every corner
of the house in great shape.

702
00:47:07,004 --> 00:47:09,680
And she knew
never to cross the line.

703
00:47:10,216 --> 00:47:13,100
I can't stand people
who cross the line.

704
00:47:13,636 --> 00:47:16,312
If just one negative point...

705
00:47:16,931 --> 00:47:18,415
eating too much?

706
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:21,442
She said she always ate two servings.

707
00:47:22,102 --> 00:47:25,964
Then again, she does do a lot of work.

708
00:47:26,065 --> 00:47:31,428
Then she'd better find someone
quickly. A new housekeeper.

709
00:47:31,529 --> 00:47:33,555
She's in big trouble right now.

710
00:47:33,656 --> 00:47:38,125
With that housekeeper, our
house will be trashed in a week.

711
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:42,171
My clothes will start to reek...

712
00:47:43,207 --> 00:47:46,109
My wife never had any talent for housework.

713
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:49,512
She's bad at cleaning,
and her cooking's god-awful.

714
00:47:50,548 --> 00:47:52,431
You still love her, right?

715
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:03,442
Of course, I love her.

716
00:48:04,478 --> 00:48:06,362
You have to call that love.

717
00:48:07,982 --> 00:48:10,157
Then, take this.

718
00:48:14,196 --> 00:48:16,389
THE CARE?
What is this?

719
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:18,975
I found out about them
just recently.

720
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:23,921
How to describe it?
It's a members-only service.

721
00:48:24,498 --> 00:48:31,029
Provides experienced maids, caregivers
and drivers like myself to VIP customers like you.

722
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:37,035
A professional service of carefully
selected experts in their fields.

723
00:48:37,136 --> 00:48:40,354
You can tell they're very exclusive
even from the card.

724
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:42,481
The design, too.

725
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:45,543
Driver Kim, how did you
come across this company?

726
00:48:45,644 --> 00:48:50,173
They contacted me, because
of my veteran-status as VIP driver.

727
00:48:50,274 --> 00:48:52,491
A kind of a scout offer?

728
00:48:54,028 --> 00:48:59,766
But, when I got their call, I was already
scheduled to interview with you.

729
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:03,044
I see...

730
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,745
Your grace for turning down work with such a
prestigious company to work for me...

731
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,300
I'm forever indebted.

732
00:49:10,836 --> 00:49:13,054
Fuck!

733
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:18,952
Anyway, I can give
this card to my wife, right?

734
00:49:19,053 --> 00:49:20,828
Yes, that's why I brought it up.

735
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:23,105
No need to mention me.

736
00:49:24,516 --> 00:49:27,693
You can tell her that you
found the company yourself.

737
00:49:28,228 --> 00:49:29,587
Sure, why not.

738
00:49:29,688 --> 00:49:32,048
Thanks to you I can
play the good husband.

739
00:49:32,149 --> 00:49:36,928
On the back, there's a
number for consultations.

740
00:49:37,029 --> 00:49:38,179
Tell her to call that...

741
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,830
Eyes on the road!

742
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:48,089
Hello, this is The Care's
senior advisor, Yeo Myung-son.

743
00:49:48,248 --> 00:49:51,717
Yes, is this The Care's main office?

744
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:55,905
She's going to be very successful,
even as a con artist.

745
00:49:56,006 --> 00:49:58,641
Isn't the tone of her voice great?
Takes after me.

746
00:50:00,177 --> 00:50:02,704
From what I've heard,
it's a members-only service?

747
00:50:02,805 --> 00:50:06,666
So, you're not currently
a member, I assume?

748
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:09,294
That's right. What steps
do I need to take?

749
00:50:09,395 --> 00:50:13,506
We will need just a few documents.

750
00:50:13,607 --> 00:50:16,593
Are you ready to write this down?

751
00:50:16,694 --> 00:50:21,580
Your family register,
copy of your family's ID cards...

752
00:50:22,282 --> 00:50:25,226
income documents to
verify your income level

753
00:50:25,327 --> 00:50:27,770
and the title of your property, etc.

754
00:50:27,871 --> 00:50:30,297
Our property title? Ah, yes.

755
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:40,158
Peaches!!

756
00:50:40,259 --> 00:50:42,393
You have some too, teacher Kevin.

757
00:50:42,511 --> 00:50:43,853
Thank you.

758
00:50:52,354 --> 00:50:55,381
Miss, just leave it outside from now.

759
00:50:55,482 --> 00:50:58,095
- Just knock.
- Yes.

760
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,126
Never enter during sessions!

761
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:02,797
Yes.

762
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:06,809
Park Da-song!

763
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,144
It's daddy!

764
00:51:08,245 --> 00:51:09,712
Where are you?

765
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:15,276
Daddy!

766
00:51:15,377 --> 00:51:16,235
Son!

767
00:51:16,336 --> 00:51:19,238
Walkie talkies!

768
00:51:19,339 --> 00:51:20,331
Walkie talkies!

769
00:51:20,432 --> 00:51:23,476
What do you like better,
me or the walkie talkies?

770
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:27,080
Da-song, what are you doing running out
during the middle of your lesson?

771
00:51:27,181 --> 00:51:30,750
When did you buy all this?

772
00:51:30,851 --> 00:51:31,793
It's no big deal.

773
00:51:31,894 --> 00:51:32,994
Huh?

774
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:37,078
Huh?

775
00:51:37,589 --> 00:51:39,295
What is it?

776
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,287
What are you doing?

777
00:51:44,123 --> 00:51:45,515
Da-song, that's enough!

778
00:51:45,616 --> 00:51:49,435
Huh? It's the same!
They smell the same!

779
00:51:49,536 --> 00:51:53,147
What nonsense! Go on up.
Teacher Jessica is waiting.

780
00:51:53,248 --> 00:51:57,301
Teacher Jessica has a similar smell, too.

781
00:51:58,337 --> 00:52:01,656
Then, do each of us have to
use different soaps?

782
00:52:01,757 --> 00:52:05,618
Father, shouldn't we use
different laundry detergents, too?

783
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:06,828
And fabric softeners?

784
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:11,249
You mean, we run the laundry for each
person separately? Geez.

785
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:13,275
That's not it.

786
00:52:13,894 --> 00:52:16,112
The stench is coming from
our semi-basement.

787
00:52:17,147 --> 00:52:19,949
To lose the smell,
we have to leave this place.

788
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:27,598
Anyway, aren't we fortunate to be
worrying about something like this?

789
00:52:27,699 --> 00:52:28,725
Sure!

790
00:52:28,826 --> 00:52:31,936
These days, even an opening for
just one security guard

791
00:52:32,037 --> 00:52:36,733
draws over 500 four-year university
graduates flocking to get the job.

792
00:52:36,834 --> 00:52:40,094
And, our entire family
got hired full time!

793
00:52:40,629 --> 00:52:42,263
That's right, Father!

794
00:52:42,798 --> 00:52:45,241
Put all our 4 salaries together...

795
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:49,687
amount of wealth that's transferred from their
household to our's every month is no joke!

796
00:52:50,264 --> 00:52:54,792
To the great Mr. Park,
let's offer a prayer of gratitude.

797
00:52:54,893 --> 00:52:56,002
And, to Min-hyuk!

798
00:52:56,103 --> 00:52:58,755
Because of Ki-woo's
amazing friend...

799
00:52:58,856 --> 00:53:03,159
Thanks to him... Oh, fuck!
Just when we're trying to have a drink!

800
00:53:07,723 --> 00:53:08,723
Oh, he's fuck'n dead!

801
00:53:08,824 --> 00:53:11,350
Whoa, Kim Ki-woo's got the spunk!

802
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:14,128
You're over-doing it!

803
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:17,482
Here, use this instead.

804
00:53:20,848 --> 00:53:22,482
Damn you!

805
00:53:25,424 --> 00:53:26,657
Get a grip!

806
00:53:26,758 --> 00:53:28,684
A grip!

807
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:32,479
Wow!

808
00:53:36,518 --> 00:53:38,944
Total innundation!

809
00:53:55,412 --> 00:53:59,190
Current weather is clear, over.
The clouds are moving in.

810
00:53:59,291 --> 00:54:01,692
But they're not rain clouds, over.

811
00:54:01,793 --> 00:54:03,152
Copy, over.

812
00:54:03,253 --> 00:54:09,575
Currently your sister's lips are pouting like a duck's bill.

813
00:54:09,676 --> 00:54:12,662
She's super annoyed, over.

814
00:54:12,763 --> 00:54:17,500
Can't I just stay behind to study English?
Ask teacher Kevin to come over?

815
00:54:17,601 --> 00:54:20,962
Hey! Just when we're about
to leave, why all the fuss?

816
00:54:21,063 --> 00:54:23,381
Since we all decided to go,
let's go in a good mood!

817
00:54:23,482 --> 00:54:26,133
Yeah, Da-hye. This is
no ordinary camping trip.

818
00:54:26,234 --> 00:54:26,968
That's right!

819
00:54:27,069 --> 00:54:28,894
As his older sister, you think it's ok
to miss your brother's birthday?

820
00:54:28,995 --> 00:54:29,887
Absolutely, not!

821
00:54:29,988 --> 00:54:32,265
Even I have taken the time out
of my very busy schedule to go.

822
00:54:32,366 --> 00:54:35,292
Of course! If you don't go,
it'll be your loss.

823
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:39,772
Oh, right. You know the
beam projector?

824
00:54:39,873 --> 00:54:40,815
The projecting thing?

825
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:43,092
Right, prepare the
outdoor beam projector.

826
00:54:43,585 --> 00:54:48,072
And look for Da-song's
camping raincoat.

827
00:54:48,173 --> 00:54:50,099
He get's excited when it rains.

828
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:54,328
You remember now?
Zoonie, Berry, and Fofoo.

829
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:55,496
Zoonie and Berry get this.

830
00:54:55,597 --> 00:54:58,416
Yes, Natural Balance Original Ultra.

831
00:54:58,517 --> 00:55:00,985
Right, and for Foofoo...

832
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,712
Kani Kamaboko.
The Japanese crab sticks.

833
00:55:02,813 --> 00:55:03,838
Yes.

834
00:55:03,939 --> 00:55:06,882
When you walk Zoonie,
give him a long leash.

835
00:55:06,983 --> 00:55:09,343
He needs to run about in
all directions to feel satisfied.

836
00:55:09,444 --> 00:55:12,871
He's like the canine version of Da-song!

837
00:55:38,432 --> 00:55:40,207
Hey, son!

838
00:55:40,308 --> 00:55:43,336
What are you doing lying out there?

839
00:55:43,437 --> 00:55:46,321
Son of a gun.
Must be hot out.

840
00:55:46,857 --> 00:55:51,577
This is lying at home,
gazing at the sky.

841
00:55:53,113 --> 00:55:54,705
It's very nice.

842
00:55:58,243 --> 00:56:00,227
Mom, want some water?

843
00:56:00,328 --> 00:56:01,771
There's sparkling, right?

844
00:56:01,872 --> 00:56:04,357
Ki-jung, want a bottle of water?

845
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:06,592
Whoa, telepathy!
Thank you.

846
00:56:29,174 --> 00:56:32,048
Whoa, yeah!

847
00:56:32,204 --> 00:56:32,704
! crash ! <i>I</i>

848
00:56:32,808 --> 00:56:35,818
Wow, all these different kinds of liquor.

849
00:56:36,615 --> 00:56:39,975
Father! I will pour you a special round.

850
00:56:40,076 --> 00:56:44,588
Wow, this is rather picturesque.

851
00:56:45,123 --> 00:56:50,277
The garden with the rain, shaaaa!
Us with the whiskey, shaaaa!

852
00:56:50,378 --> 00:56:55,099
But, son. What's that yellow notebook
you've been carrying around?

853
00:56:55,759 --> 00:56:59,203
This? It's Da-hye's diary.

854
00:56:59,304 --> 00:57:00,788
Diary?

855
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:05,150
That's really disgusting.
Why are you reading her diary?

856
00:57:05,685 --> 00:57:10,965
So we can understand each other
more deeply - in a positive way.

857
00:57:11,066 --> 00:57:13,784
Fuck. You two dating?

858
00:57:13,944 --> 00:57:18,413
I'm serious!
She likes me a lot too.

859
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,792
A while back...

860
00:57:22,828 --> 00:57:24,086
Never mind.

861
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:28,023
When she enters university,
I intend to officially ask her out.

862
00:57:28,124 --> 00:57:29,508
Seriously.

863
00:57:34,089 --> 00:57:36,140
Oh, my son!

864
00:57:36,299 --> 00:57:40,894
Then, this house will become
your in-laws' house?

865
00:57:44,391 --> 00:57:48,210
Fuck, then I've been here
washing my in-laws' dishes?

866
00:57:48,275 --> 00:57:52,645
Sure! Washing his father-in-law's underwear
and washing your daughter-in-law's socks!

867
00:58:03,535 --> 00:58:08,981
I think... she's alright.
She's well-behaved.

868
00:58:09,082 --> 00:58:13,385
Pretty-like, but
not spoiled rotten.

869
00:58:14,421 --> 00:58:18,599
Well, now that we're projecting...

870
00:58:19,676 --> 00:58:22,286
If Da-hye and I get married...

871
00:58:22,387 --> 00:58:26,231
Your roles can be
hired out to actors.

872
00:58:27,209 --> 00:58:28,209
She...

873
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:32,171
She did so many part-time gigs
at weddings last year.

874
00:58:32,272 --> 00:58:36,592
I even had to catch bouquets
from bitches I've never met.

875
00:58:36,693 --> 00:58:39,678
If you catch the bouquet,
they pay you extra $10.

876
00:58:39,779 --> 00:58:41,806
That's how your acting
improved so much!

877
00:58:41,907 --> 00:58:47,394
Acting is one thing, but
this family is so gullible, right?

878
00:58:47,495 --> 00:58:49,688
The madame, especially.

879
00:58:49,789 --> 00:58:51,798
You said it.

880
00:58:53,335 --> 00:58:56,904
She's so naive,
and so nice!

881
00:58:57,005 --> 00:58:58,906
She's rich, but still nice.

882
00:58:59,007 --> 00:59:01,367
It's not, "rich, but still nice."

883
00:59:01,468 --> 00:59:05,395
It's, "nice because she's rich!"
You know what I'm saying?

884
00:59:05,931 --> 00:59:12,444
Hell, if I had all this money

885
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,383
I'd be even nicer!

886
00:59:17,484 --> 00:59:18,992
Nicer!

887
00:59:19,152 --> 00:59:21,470
That's true.
Your mom's right.

888
00:59:21,571 --> 00:59:23,973
Rich people are naive.
Not tied up in knots all the time.

889
00:59:24,074 --> 00:59:26,350
Kids from rich families are bright
and happy... no wrinkles.

890
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:29,854
It's the iron.
Money is the iron.

891
00:59:29,955 --> 00:59:32,356
Those wrinkles are
all smoothed out.

892
00:59:32,457 --> 00:59:34,007
Hey, Ki-woo.

893
00:59:34,626 --> 00:59:39,680
You know that driver Yoon?
His sir name was Yoon, right?

894
00:59:40,215 --> 00:59:42,449
The driver before me.

895
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:43,742
Yes, 'Yoon.'

896
00:59:43,843 --> 00:59:48,414
He must be working somewhere now,
right? ...having found a job?

897
00:59:48,515 --> 00:59:50,833
Sure, he must have.

898
00:59:50,934 --> 00:59:54,528
He's of younger age
and of good physique...

899
00:59:55,063 --> 00:59:58,132
Right, he must have
gone to a better employer.

900
00:59:58,233 --> 01:00:00,325
Fucking hell, come on!

901
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,345
What's with her?

902
01:00:03,446 --> 01:00:09,918
We're our biggest problem.
Let's just worry about us, okay?

903
01:00:10,036 --> 01:00:13,439
Dad ! Dad ! Dad!

904
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:17,860
Please give us some
focus, okay? Us!

905
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:22,281
Not driver Yoon,
but to me, please!

906
01:00:22,382 --> 01:00:24,617
Killer timing, huh?

907
01:00:24,718 --> 01:00:28,812
Wow, Ki-jung goes, "Kyaaaa! !"
and the lightning goes, "Boooom ! !"

908
01:00:30,473 --> 01:00:33,567
Hey, Jessica.
Bottoms up!

909
01:00:34,602 --> 01:00:40,049
Hey, when I went up earlier,
and you were in the bath...

910
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:42,075
Bath. What about it?

911
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:46,013
How to put it?
You fit right in.

912
01:00:46,114 --> 01:00:48,749
This rich house atmosphere suits
you very well. You're not like us.

913
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:49,850
Fuck off.

914
01:00:49,951 --> 01:00:50,809
I'm serious!

915
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:52,561
Seriously, father.
Earlier...

916
01:00:52,662 --> 01:00:55,547
she was lying back in the tub
watching TV

917
01:00:56,082 --> 01:00:58,633
like she's lived here for years.

918
01:01:00,211 --> 01:01:06,158
Speaking of which,
if this house became our's

919
01:01:06,259 --> 01:01:10,496
assuming we lived here,
which room would you choose?

920
01:01:10,597 --> 01:01:15,793
I'm asking which room you like best in this
masterpeice of the great architect Nam-goong.

921
01:01:15,894 --> 01:01:17,753
Fuck, I don't know!

922
01:01:17,854 --> 01:01:21,656
First let me live here,
then I'll worry about it.

923
01:01:22,192 --> 01:01:24,326
We already live here, don't we?

924
01:01:24,861 --> 01:01:28,663
Drinking in the middle of the
living room like this.

925
01:01:28,782 --> 01:01:31,517
Right, this is 'living here.'
What's more to it?

926
01:01:31,618 --> 01:01:36,271
This is our home right now.
It's cosy.

927
01:01:36,372 --> 01:01:39,358
Are you cosy?
Are you feeling cosy?

928
01:01:39,459 --> 01:01:44,554
Sure, but suppose Mr. Park suddenly
walked through that door right now.

929
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,407
Kim Ki-taek, this human being...

930
01:01:46,508 --> 01:01:50,143
would scatter and hide like a cockroach.

931
01:01:50,678 --> 01:01:52,830
Kids, you know at our house when

932
01:01:52,931 --> 01:01:58,669
we turn on the fluorescent light at night,
how the cockroaches scatter and hide?

933
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:00,654
You know what I mean?

934
01:02:01,231 --> 01:02:04,574
Fucking getting tired of listening to this...

935
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:06,993
- What? A cockroach?
- Yeah!

936
01:02:10,532 --> 01:02:12,391
Huh? What are you doing?

937
01:02:12,492 --> 01:02:13,600
Really?

938
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:17,712
Father, don't do it!
You're gonna kill somebody.

939
01:02:24,754 --> 01:02:26,447
What the hell!

940
01:02:26,548 --> 01:02:28,157
Fooled you.
Fooled you!

941
01:02:28,258 --> 01:02:29,575
Father, you're so...

942
01:02:29,676 --> 01:02:33,746
Ki-woo, you were fooled too!
Very real, wasn't it?

943
01:02:33,847 --> 01:02:37,541
If it was for real,
you'd be dead, you fucker!

944
01:02:37,642 --> 01:02:41,695
What the fuck?! Pet...?

945
01:02:47,235 --> 01:02:49,470
What the...
Who is it at this hour?

946
01:02:49,571 --> 01:02:51,455
Who is it?

947
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:58,729
Why, she...?

948
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:01,923
Fuck, that's that woman, isn't it?

949
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:04,301
Why is she here?

950
01:03:04,836 --> 01:03:08,722
She keeps, keeps, keeps ringing.

951
01:03:09,757 --> 01:03:12,642
Causing a ruckus in the neighborhood.

952
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:14,620
Who is it?

953
01:03:14,721 --> 01:03:19,541
Oh, how do you do? I'm...

954
01:03:19,642 --> 01:03:21,251
Um... the madame's not in, right?

955
01:03:21,352 --> 01:03:22,252
What?

956
01:03:22,353 --> 01:03:26,948
I worked here
for a very long time.

957
01:03:27,483 --> 01:03:33,013
Above the monitor there,
you see the photo of 3 dogs, right?

958
01:03:33,114 --> 01:03:34,556
Zoonie, Berry, Foofoo.

959
01:03:34,657 --> 01:03:39,186
I get it, but what do you
want at this hour?

960
01:03:39,287 --> 01:03:43,924
You're the woman who came as
my successor. Am I right?

961
01:03:48,963 --> 01:03:50,722
Anyway...

962
01:03:51,257 --> 01:03:54,535
I'm very sorry
to call on you so late.

963
01:03:54,636 --> 01:03:56,520
It's just that...

964
01:03:57,055 --> 01:04:03,818
I left something of mine in the
kitchen basement. Unintentionally.

965
01:04:04,354 --> 01:04:10,742
When I quit, they pushed me out
so abruptly without proper notice.

966
01:04:13,821 --> 01:04:15,997
Could you open the door?

967
01:04:18,034 --> 01:04:20,126
What do we do?

968
01:04:20,662 --> 01:04:22,921
This wasn't in the plan.

969
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:32,180
Please excuse me.

970
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:33,740
This way.

971
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:35,475
Yes, thank you.

972
01:04:37,512 --> 01:04:39,454
Put your raincoat here...

973
01:04:39,555 --> 01:04:42,148
I'll be very quick and leaving.

974
01:04:42,725 --> 01:04:46,378
Oh, you did a lot of cooking there.
What a big mess to clean up!

975
01:04:46,479 --> 01:04:49,864
But, what is it that
you left behind below?

976
01:04:54,404 --> 01:04:56,997
Want to come down with me?

977
01:04:58,032 --> 01:05:01,376
Just be back quickly.

978
01:05:54,464 --> 01:05:57,807
Help me push this!

979
01:05:57,925 --> 01:06:00,410
Pull it! From over there!

980
01:06:00,511 --> 01:06:02,079
What?

981
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,280
Pull!

982
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,651
Harder!

983
01:06:11,189 --> 01:06:12,697
Are you alright?

984
01:06:14,233 --> 01:06:15,533
I startled you.

985
01:06:18,071 --> 01:06:19,621
Thank you ! Thank you!

986
01:06:20,698 --> 01:06:22,123
Thank you!

987
01:06:30,108 --> 01:06:31,108
Honey!

988
01:06:31,209 --> 01:06:32,342
What the hell?

989
01:06:33,878 --> 01:06:34,945
Hey, you!

990
01:06:35,046 --> 01:06:36,596
Honey!

991
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:39,182
Honey!

992
01:06:41,577 --> 01:06:42,577
Lady!

993
01:06:42,678 --> 01:06:44,871
Honey, I'm here! Honey!

994
01:06:44,972 --> 01:06:46,272
What the?

995
01:06:50,186 --> 01:06:51,837
Honey, I'm fine.

996
01:06:51,938 --> 01:06:53,697
Of course you're not!

997
01:06:53,798 --> 01:06:54,798
I'm fine, really.

998
01:06:54,899 --> 01:06:56,133
You are not fine!

999
01:06:56,234 --> 01:06:58,010
I'm so hungry.

1000
01:06:58,111 --> 01:06:59,011
Take this. Take this.

1001
01:06:59,112 --> 01:07:02,347
How many days have you gone hungry?

1002
01:07:02,448 --> 01:07:04,165
Honey, you've been so very hungry!

1003
01:07:06,202 --> 01:07:07,477
It's okay. It's okay.

1004
01:07:07,578 --> 01:07:10,272
She's a good woman.
I got in, thanks to her.

1005
01:07:10,373 --> 01:07:12,482
It was the iron plate.
Iron plate for grilling meats.

1006
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:14,026
It was wedged under the shelf.

1007
01:07:14,127 --> 01:07:15,193
No wonder.

1008
01:07:15,294 --> 01:07:18,697
Strangely, no matter how much I tried,
it wouldn't budge from the inside.

1009
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:22,308
- What is this?
- I know you're freaked out.

1010
01:07:22,427 --> 01:07:25,019
I would be freaked out, too!

1011
01:07:25,138 --> 01:07:29,666
As fellow workers...
Right, sister Chung-sook?

1012
01:07:29,767 --> 01:07:32,610
How do you know my name?

1013
01:07:33,146 --> 01:07:37,841
Acutally, I still text
with the youngest, Da-song.

1014
01:07:37,942 --> 01:07:42,512
I came knowing that the family
would be away camping.

1015
01:07:42,613 --> 01:07:45,390
I wanted to speak with you, privately.

1016
01:07:45,491 --> 01:07:46,666
"Talking about."

1017
01:07:49,203 --> 01:07:51,521
Don't worry,
big sister Chung-sook.

1018
01:07:51,622 --> 01:07:55,359
I cut the wire to the
CCTV by the gate.

1019
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:59,071
Nobody knows I'm here.
I did a good job, right sister?

1020
01:07:59,172 --> 01:08:01,239
Sister this, sister that...
Do you know me?

1021
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:04,309
Sister, my name is
Moon-gwang.

1022
01:08:04,844 --> 01:08:08,914
This is my hubbie, Oh Geun-sae.
Say hello, honey.

1023
01:08:09,015 --> 01:08:12,334
So tasty!
But, why is your face like that?

1024
01:08:12,435 --> 01:08:15,278
Let's talk about that
another time.

1025
01:08:15,855 --> 01:08:19,758
So, while working here,
you looted the kitchen everyday

1026
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:20,884
to feed your husband!

1027
01:08:20,985 --> 01:08:25,638
Not at all! What he eats,
I bought with my own salary!

1028
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:28,808
That's really unfair.
Really unfair.

1029
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:31,520
Then, how long has your
husband lived down here?

1030
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:34,464
Oh my, hold on...
has it been 4 years?

1031
01:08:34,999 --> 01:08:37,651
4 years, 3 months
and 17 days.

1032
01:08:37,752 --> 01:08:39,718
Right, it's June now.

1033
01:08:40,254 --> 01:08:46,142
Four years ago, after Mr. Nam-goong
moved away to Paris

1034
01:08:46,302 --> 01:08:49,312
and before Mr. Park's family moved in

1035
01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:52,915
I brought my husband
down here, stealth-like.

1036
01:08:53,017 --> 01:08:58,046
Rich folks have secret bunkers
in case of a North Korean invasion

1037
01:08:58,147 --> 01:09:02,676
or to hide from creditors.
It's quite common.

1038
01:09:02,776 --> 01:09:08,957
Mr. Nam-goong was very embarrassed
about having made this secrete bunker.

1039
01:09:09,116 --> 01:09:12,977
Anyway, he never mentioned it
to Mr. Park's family.

1040
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:14,396
So, only I knew about this...

1041
01:09:14,497 --> 01:09:16,982
I see, so that's how it all happened.

1042
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:21,194
Now that I know, I have no choice
but to call the police!

1043
01:09:21,294 --> 01:09:23,721
No please, sister!

1044
01:09:24,339 --> 01:09:26,616
Please let's not do this to each other.
We're both needy people.

1045
01:09:26,717 --> 01:09:28,118
I'm not needy people!

1046
01:09:28,218 --> 01:09:31,997
But we are needy!

1047
01:09:32,098 --> 01:09:36,584
We have no home and no money.
All we have are debts!

1048
01:09:36,686 --> 01:09:37,836
Sister, please!

1049
01:09:37,937 --> 01:09:42,382
Even with 4 years of hiding,
debt collectors never let up.

1050
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:46,636
They're still searching for him,
threatening to mangle him.

1051
01:09:46,737 --> 01:09:48,538
You borrowed from loan sharks?

1052
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:51,416
It's all my fault. Me.

1053
01:09:51,951 --> 01:09:53,251
The castella bakery...

1054
01:09:53,786 --> 01:09:57,564
My Taiwanese Wangshui castella
bakery business went bust

1055
01:09:57,665 --> 01:09:59,941
and I fell into big debt.

1056
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:01,801
Please take this.

1057
01:10:01,919 --> 01:10:03,303
What's this?

1058
01:10:03,838 --> 01:10:07,699
It's not much,
just a teeny weeny sum

1059
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,786
but we'll send it to you
every month.

1060
01:10:10,887 --> 01:10:12,621
In return, just
once every two days

1061
01:10:12,722 --> 01:10:16,191
please put some
food together for him.

1062
01:10:16,726 --> 01:10:19,736
No, no, ...just
once every week.

1063
01:10:20,271 --> 01:10:22,464
There's even a refrigerator.
Just once a week.

1064
01:10:22,565 --> 01:10:25,008
You've got some nerve!
I'm calling the police.

1065
01:10:25,109 --> 01:10:26,326
Sister, sister!

1066
01:10:29,363 --> 01:10:30,580
What's that?

1067
01:10:33,618 --> 01:10:35,501
Wait...
Jessica?

1068
01:10:36,037 --> 01:10:37,062
Driver Kim?

1069
01:10:37,163 --> 01:10:38,263
What is this?

1070
01:10:39,749 --> 01:10:40,816
Father, my ankle!

1071
01:10:40,917 --> 01:10:42,108
Don't press it!

1072
01:10:42,209 --> 01:10:44,110
Father, my arm, my arm!

1073
01:10:44,211 --> 01:10:45,887
What are you doing calling me Father?

1074
01:10:53,429 --> 01:10:57,232
No wonder! I thought it so weird
starting with when driver Yoon was fired.

1075
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:58,458
Hey!

1076
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:01,002
Ma'am, let's talk things over.

1077
01:11:01,103 --> 01:11:02,462
What are you, a family
of charlatans or something?

1078
01:11:02,563 --> 01:11:03,380
So, little sister...

1079
01:11:03,481 --> 01:11:05,990
Little sister, my ass, you bitch !
Shut your pie hole!

1080
01:11:06,525 --> 01:11:11,304
I'm gonna send this video to Mrs. Park.
What do you think about that?

1081
01:11:13,699 --> 01:11:15,917
No reception here
in the basement, right?

1082
01:11:16,452 --> 01:11:18,311
- This basement has good signals.
- Fuck!

1083
01:11:18,412 --> 01:11:23,024
Ma'am, to be honest, because we so
desperately needed the...

1084
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:26,152
Shut up! I don't want to hear it.
We're going down together!

1085
01:11:26,253 --> 01:11:29,489
Whether to the police or to jail,
we're going down together, everybody!

1086
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:33,101
Woman ! Are you crazy?

1087
01:11:33,636 --> 01:11:38,623
If Mr. and Mrs. Park see that video,
how shocked they will be!

1088
01:11:38,724 --> 01:11:42,110
Those nice people...
what fault is it of their's?

1089
01:11:42,461 --> 01:11:43,461
Why do this to them?

1090
01:11:43,562 --> 01:11:45,255
Don't come any closer!

1091
01:11:45,356 --> 01:11:47,716
Or, I'll press the 'send' button.

1092
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:49,784
Follow me.

1093
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:52,745
Ma'am, please calm down.

1094
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,878
Let's go up, honey.

1095
01:12:01,414 --> 01:12:04,299
Time for you to breath
some fresh air!

1096
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:27,655
Honey, this 'send' button
is like a missile launcher.

1097
01:12:27,815 --> 01:12:29,574
What do you mean, honey?

1098
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:35,430
If we threaten to push this button,
those people can't do anything.

1099
01:12:35,531 --> 01:12:40,043
It's like a North Korean rocket.
A North Korean missile button!

1100
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:45,023
Today our beloved
Great Leader, Kim Jong-un

1101
01:12:45,124 --> 01:12:48,193
after witnessing the video of
the family of charlatans

1102
01:12:48,294 --> 01:12:51,029
was unable to contain
his shock and fury

1103
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:54,366
at their wicked,
despicable provocations!

1104
01:12:54,467 --> 01:12:56,242
I've missed this, honey!

1105
01:12:56,343 --> 01:13:00,872
Therefore, our Great Leader
in this age of de-nuclearization

1106
01:13:00,973 --> 01:13:06,753
has commanded that the nation's
last remaining nuclear warhead

1107
01:13:06,854 --> 01:13:09,339
be driven down the throats
of this wicked family!

1108
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:14,135
No one can imitate North Korean news
anchors like you ! I love you, honey!

1109
01:13:14,236 --> 01:13:19,265
With their stinking guts serving
as the last nuclear graveyard

1110
01:13:19,366 --> 01:13:24,270
our Dear Leader's wish to de-nuclearize
and bring world peace...

1111
01:13:24,371 --> 01:13:26,381
Hands in the air, assholes!

1112
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:28,049
Higher!

1113
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,987
You fucking family.

1114
01:13:32,088 --> 01:13:33,162
Husband?

1115
01:13:33,263 --> 01:13:34,072
Husband.

1116
01:13:34,173 --> 01:13:34,956
Wife?

1117
01:13:35,057 --> 01:13:35,907
Yes.

1118
01:13:36,008 --> 01:13:37,008
Son?

1119
01:13:37,109 --> 01:13:37,875
Yes.

1120
01:13:37,976 --> 01:13:39,035
- Daughter?
- Daughter.

1121
01:13:39,136 --> 01:13:41,079
You low-lifes!

1122
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:45,542
All you can think to do is,
to drink yourselves like dogs?

1123
01:13:45,643 --> 01:13:50,922
In the center of Mr. Nam-goon's living room
where his creative soul dwells?

1124
01:13:51,023 --> 01:13:52,048
You cretins!

1125
01:13:52,149 --> 01:13:53,466
What do you know of art?

1126
01:13:53,567 --> 01:13:55,827
What would they know?

1127
01:13:56,487 --> 01:14:04,410
On a sunny day, the two of us
would bask in the sunbeam

1128
01:14:05,246 --> 01:14:09,882
and in those moments,
we could feel his artistic touch.

1129
01:14:57,756 --> 01:15:01,267
Give it to me!

1130
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:23,831
Good job! Delete it!

1131
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:27,460
Careful! Don't press
'send' by accident.

1132
01:15:42,009 --> 01:15:43,109
Hello?

1133
01:15:43,636 --> 01:15:47,146
Listen, you know how to make
Chapa-guri, right?

1134
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:48,915
Chapa-guri?

1135
01:15:49,016 --> 01:15:52,693
Chapa-guri is Da-song's favorite.

1136
01:15:52,853 --> 01:15:56,548
If you boil the water right away,
the timing will be perfect.

1137
01:15:56,649 --> 01:15:59,384
There's premium Korean sirloin
in the fridge, add that too.

1138
01:15:59,485 --> 01:16:01,010
Then, the camp...?

1139
01:16:01,111 --> 01:16:04,830
My god, what a disaster!

1140
01:16:05,366 --> 01:16:10,628
Nearby river overflowed and
caused a chaos of campers packing up.

1141
01:16:10,746 --> 01:16:13,773
Da-song was crying and throwing
a tantrum, refusing to go home!

1142
01:16:13,874 --> 01:16:18,010
Anyway, Chapa-guri to be served
immediately upon our arrival, okay?

1143
01:16:18,128 --> 01:16:20,613
Then, you're almost here?

1144
01:16:20,714 --> 01:16:23,266
8 minutes, according to the GPS.

1145
01:16:23,659 --> 01:16:24,659
Arrival in 8 minutes...

1146
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,479
Hang up the phone
and put the water on.

1147
01:16:32,518 --> 01:16:34,235
What the hell is Chapa-guri?

1148
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:45,079
Get up, quickly!

1149
01:16:46,865 --> 01:16:47,965
Move!

1150
01:16:58,516 --> 01:17:01,163
Father! I can't do this!

1151
01:17:12,433 --> 01:17:14,317
Why are you doing this?

1152
01:17:15,436 --> 01:17:17,278
Father!

1153
01:17:20,316 --> 01:17:23,534
Go up quickly! Quickly!

1154
01:17:31,076 --> 01:17:32,176
Hey, this!

1155
01:17:51,513 --> 01:17:52,705
You're home!

1156
01:17:52,806 --> 01:17:56,150
Da-song, look!
Let's eat Chapa-guri!

1157
01:17:58,312 --> 01:17:59,820
Da-song!

1158
01:18:02,441 --> 01:18:04,450
Da-song!

1159
01:18:10,991 --> 01:18:12,375
Madame!

1160
01:18:30,969 --> 01:18:32,829
Maybe you'll have to
eat the Chapa-guri.

1161
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:33,705
Your sure?

1162
01:18:33,806 --> 01:18:36,874
No, wait. I can give it to
Das-song's dad.

1163
01:18:36,975 --> 01:18:39,068
There's premium
Korean sirloin in here.

1164
01:18:41,605 --> 01:18:45,366
The meat is cooked through to the center,
right? Medium well-done.

1165
01:19:10,426 --> 01:19:16,331
! Returning after a day's work. !
! I love you so much, Mr. Park! <i>I</i>

1166
01:19:16,432 --> 01:19:22,945
! Home from the office, <i>I
I</i> Mr. Park is off duty now. <i>I</i>

1167
01:19:24,606 --> 01:19:28,885
! Returning after a day's work, !
! I love you so much, Mr. Park! <i>I</i>

1168
01:19:28,986 --> 01:19:31,078
- What's this?
- Silence!

1169
01:19:42,624 --> 01:19:45,026
Honey, do you want some
Chapa-guri?

1170
01:19:45,127 --> 01:19:46,152
Da-song doesn't want it?

1171
01:19:46,253 --> 01:19:46,903
No.

1172
01:19:47,004 --> 01:19:48,929
No, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

1173
01:19:49,465 --> 01:19:52,224
Why are you staring at me like that?
It's embarrassing.

1174
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:56,746
Mr. Park. Today, you
feed me again and house me.

1175
01:19:56,847 --> 01:19:58,355
Respect!

1176
01:20:00,392 --> 01:20:02,067
You do this every day?

1177
01:20:02,603 --> 01:20:08,073
Sure, I even send entire
sentences to thank him.

1178
01:20:08,609 --> 01:20:10,718
Someone of your age should know this.

1179
01:20:10,819 --> 01:20:11,677
What?

1180
01:20:11,778 --> 01:20:13,579
Morse Code.

1181
01:20:14,156 --> 01:20:18,167
That sensor's going batty.

1182
01:20:26,335 --> 01:20:29,862
Da-song should know it,
since he's a Scout.

1183
01:20:29,963 --> 01:20:31,656
It looks ridiculous,
doesn't it?

1184
01:20:31,757 --> 01:20:35,243
Why make so much fuss
trying to please a kid.

1185
01:20:35,344 --> 01:20:37,328
He's not even some kind of prince.

1186
01:20:37,429 --> 01:20:40,189
He's the youngest.
It's understandable.

1187
01:20:41,225 --> 01:20:42,733
Please understand.

1188
01:20:43,268 --> 01:20:47,029
Da-song is a bit...
shall we say, unwell?

1189
01:20:47,272 --> 01:20:50,324
He's receiving treatment for
trauma, art therapy, etc.

1190
01:20:51,235 --> 01:20:53,261
There was an incident.

1191
01:20:53,362 --> 01:20:54,745
What kind of...?

1192
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:58,958
You believe in demons, don't you?

1193
01:21:00,077 --> 01:21:04,004
When he was in the 1st grade,
Da-song saw a demon in the house.

1194
01:21:10,546 --> 01:21:12,947
In the 1st grade, the day we had
his birthday party at home.

1195
01:21:13,048 --> 01:21:15,491
Late that night, when
everyone was sleeping

1196
01:21:15,592 --> 01:21:20,163
Da-song crept down to the kitchen
and took out the leftover cake.

1197
01:21:20,264 --> 01:21:23,332
The fresh whipped cream
on that cake was amazing.

1198
01:21:23,433 --> 01:21:26,360
Lying in his bed, he couldn't get
the cake out of his mind.

1199
01:21:26,895 --> 01:21:32,283
So, Da-song was sitting there
eating his cake when...

1200
01:21:41,827 --> 01:21:44,795
He screamed, "Kyaaaa ! ! !"
and I ran downstairs.

1201
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:47,298
And, he was all...

1202
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:53,178
his eyes rolled back, shaking in
convulsion, foaming at the mouth.

1203
01:21:55,215 --> 01:21:57,450
Have you ever seen your
own child go into a seizure?

1204
01:21:57,551 --> 01:21:58,284
No.

1205
01:21:58,385 --> 01:22:03,664
If you can't treat it within
15-minutes, it's all over.

1206
01:22:03,765 --> 01:22:08,944
That's the maximum time you have
to reach the ER. 15 minutes.

1207
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:14,717
You can actually live like this?
In a place like this?

1208
01:22:14,818 --> 01:22:18,012
There's plenty more people
that live underground.

1209
01:22:18,113 --> 01:22:20,014
There's even more
if you count the semi-basements.

1210
01:22:20,115 --> 01:22:24,710
What are you going to do next?
You don't even have a plan, do you?

1211
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:28,505
I just feel comfortable here. Just so.

1212
01:22:29,583 --> 01:22:32,801
It feels like I was born here.

1213
01:22:33,462 --> 01:22:36,739
Maybe, I had my wedding here, too.

1214
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:40,267
As for the National Pension,
it doesn't apply to me.

1215
01:22:41,386 --> 01:22:45,022
You live out your old age
on nothing but affection.

1216
01:22:46,558 --> 01:22:51,946
So please, let me
continue to live down here.

1217
01:22:53,482 --> 01:22:55,199
Anyway...

1218
01:22:55,734 --> 01:23:00,788
My husband was away on business,
so I had to deal the utter chaos.

1219
01:23:01,406 --> 01:23:05,726
Since then, we've always
gone out for his birthdays.

1220
01:23:05,827 --> 01:23:08,854
Last year at my mother's house.
This year, the camping trip.

1221
01:23:08,955 --> 01:23:13,818
Da-song's dad says
all kids grow up like that.

1222
01:23:13,919 --> 01:23:18,764
He said, living in a house once possessed by a
demon is good for business and prosperity.

1223
01:23:19,925 --> 01:23:24,937
Actually, the business has been
very good the last few years.

1224
01:23:51,498 --> 01:23:53,549
Oh, man...

1225
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:23,037
Stay here for now.

1226
01:24:33,623 --> 01:24:35,674
Zoonie, what's wrong?

1227
01:24:37,711 --> 01:24:39,219
Something under there?

1228
01:24:40,797 --> 01:24:42,556
What is it?

1229
01:24:43,592 --> 01:24:44,808
Damn it!

1230
01:24:46,344 --> 01:24:47,370
- Mom !
- Yeah?

1231
01:24:47,471 --> 01:24:49,872
- How could you?
- What?

1232
01:24:49,973 --> 01:24:54,093
I like Chapa-guri too!
How could you not ask me, even once?

1233
01:24:54,194 --> 01:24:54,919
Well...

1234
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:59,090
Da-song didn't want it,
so you asked Dad, then ate it yourself.

1235
01:24:59,191 --> 01:25:00,007
Want to ask ajumma
to make some more?

1236
01:25:00,108 --> 01:25:02,009
No, that's not the point!

1237
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:05,805
- Why are you fussing over ramen noodles!
- Why didn't you ask me?

1238
01:25:05,906 --> 01:25:09,416
Oh, stop it! Go to bed, quickly.
Go get changed into your pajamas.

1239
01:25:12,996 --> 01:25:14,588
This way!

1240
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:16,683
Shhh!

1241
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:20,344
Ki-jung is under there!
Hurry, hurry!

1242
01:25:23,507 --> 01:25:25,825
One, two, three!
One, two, three!

1243
01:25:25,926 --> 01:25:27,368
Da-song, what are you doing?

1244
01:25:27,469 --> 01:25:30,187
Da-song!

1245
01:25:30,722 --> 01:25:33,190
He's crazy! Crazy!
Umbrella, please.

1246
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:34,858
Hey, Park Da-song!

1247
01:25:36,394 --> 01:25:41,173
Son of a gun...
What the hell is he doing?

1248
01:25:41,274 --> 01:25:45,052
Da-song, it's time for bed !
Do you know what time it is?

1249
01:25:45,153 --> 01:25:46,253
Here.

1250
01:25:47,197 --> 01:25:48,497
Honey, take this.

1251
01:25:52,077 --> 01:25:58,757
Who do you take after to be
so stubborn? Look at this rain!

1252
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:15,149
Channel 3 for emergencies!
Keep it turned on.

1253
01:26:15,725 --> 01:26:18,919
Give it to me.
I can't believe him.

1254
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:21,655
Just leave him be.
He'll come in when he's tired.

1255
01:26:24,951 --> 01:26:25,926
Hey, Da-hye!

1256
01:26:26,027 --> 01:26:28,620
Why are you on your phone
so much? Go to bed.

1257
01:26:29,155 --> 01:26:31,599
Go on to your room and sleep.
We'll take care of things here.

1258
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:34,727
This is the living room,
do you copy?

1259
01:26:34,828 --> 01:26:35,936
Copy, over.

1260
01:26:36,037 --> 01:26:40,232
Daddy is standing by for
emergencies, over.

1261
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:43,093
Got it, over.

1262
01:26:44,129 --> 01:26:46,071
I suppose that tent is not going to leak?

1263
01:26:46,172 --> 01:26:49,492
That's U.S. made.
It'll be fine.

1264
01:26:49,593 --> 01:26:52,620
- Should we sleep here on the sofa?
- What?

1265
01:26:52,721 --> 01:26:54,914
We have a direct line of sight to the tent.

1266
01:26:55,015 --> 01:26:56,874
Good idea.
I'll feel much better.

1267
01:26:56,975 --> 01:26:57,708
Right?

1268
01:26:57,809 --> 01:26:59,818
Let's sleep while
watching over Da-song.

1269
01:27:01,855 --> 01:27:03,280
That son of a gun.

1270
01:27:12,824 --> 01:27:14,041
Wait a minute!

1271
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:18,604
That stench is coming
from somewhere.

1272
01:27:18,705 --> 01:27:20,130
What stench?

1273
01:27:20,665 --> 01:27:22,007
Driver Kim's smell.

1274
01:27:22,542 --> 01:27:23,926
- Driver Kim?
- Yeah.

1275
01:27:24,544 --> 01:27:25,903
Not sure.

1276
01:27:26,004 --> 01:27:29,181
Really? You must know it already.

1277
01:27:29,716 --> 01:27:33,285
That stench that wafts through the car.
...how to describe it?

1278
01:27:33,386 --> 01:27:35,746
- An old man's smell?
- No no, it's not that.

1279
01:27:35,847 --> 01:27:38,106
Then, what is it?

1280
01:27:38,642 --> 01:27:40,525
Like old dried radish?

1281
01:27:41,144 --> 01:27:42,361
No.

1282
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:44,713
You know that smell
when you boil a rag?

1283
01:27:44,814 --> 01:27:46,198
It smells like that.

1284
01:27:48,735 --> 01:27:55,099
Anyway, although he always seems
like he's about to cross the line

1285
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,435
he never actually crosses it.
That's good.

1286
01:27:58,536 --> 01:28:00,170
- I'll give him credit for that.
- Yeah.

1287
01:28:01,289 --> 01:28:04,049
But that stink,
that crosses the line.

1288
01:28:04,584 --> 01:28:06,802
It powers right through
to the back seat.

1289
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,696
What smell is it?

1290
01:28:08,797 --> 01:28:10,013
I don't know.

1291
01:28:11,049 --> 01:28:13,433
It's hard to describe in words.

1292
01:28:14,469 --> 01:28:17,913
But you sometimes
smell it on the subways.

1293
01:28:18,014 --> 01:28:21,441
It's been ages since I rode a subway.

1294
01:28:21,977 --> 01:28:24,920
People who ride the subway
have that unique smell.

1295
01:28:25,021 --> 01:28:26,446
Yeah.

1296
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:45,632
Isn't this like the back seat of my car?

1297
01:28:46,292 --> 01:28:49,761
What if Da-song comes back in?

1298
01:28:50,296 --> 01:28:51,930
Don't worry!

1299
01:28:52,465 --> 01:28:55,142
I can just pull my hand back.

1300
01:29:00,682 --> 01:29:02,316
We shouldn't...

1301
01:29:08,857 --> 01:29:10,240
Clockwise.

1302
01:29:10,775 --> 01:29:11,875
Right.

1303
01:29:15,238 --> 01:29:18,540
You know where.

1304
01:29:35,091 --> 01:29:38,602
You still have those cheap panties?

1305
01:29:38,782 --> 01:29:39,882
Huh?

1306
01:29:40,138 --> 01:29:42,898
The one Yoon's bitch left behind.

1307
01:29:44,017 --> 01:29:47,110
If you wear those,
fuck, it'll turn me on.

1308
01:29:47,645 --> 01:29:48,987
Really?

1309
01:29:49,522 --> 01:29:52,532
Then get me some drugs.

1310
01:29:53,109 --> 01:29:56,703
Get me some drugs!

1311
01:29:57,781 --> 01:29:59,247
Take this instead.

1312
01:30:11,294 --> 01:30:12,427
You like it?

1313
01:31:10,019 --> 01:31:12,446
Emergency!
Emergency, over!

1314
01:31:14,983 --> 01:31:16,366
- Emergency!
- What?

1315
01:31:17,385 --> 01:31:18,385
What is it? Over.

1316
01:31:18,486 --> 01:31:20,054
Da-song, what's wrong?

1317
01:31:20,155 --> 01:31:22,622
I can't sleep, over.

1318
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:26,643
So stop it and come in, okay?

1319
01:31:26,744 --> 01:31:29,396
Go sleep in your soft bed, over.

1320
01:31:29,497 --> 01:31:30,814
Right!

1321
01:31:30,915 --> 01:31:33,258
I don't want to, over.

1322
01:31:33,793 --> 01:31:35,218
Hey, Park Da-song.

1323
01:31:40,383 --> 01:31:42,726
Let's just sleep...

1324
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:21,241
What happened back there?

1325
01:33:22,277 --> 01:33:23,377
What?

1326
01:33:25,697 --> 01:33:27,747
The people in the basement.

1327
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:34,838
Well, I tied them up real tight.

1328
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:37,299
What are you going to do?

1329
01:33:38,418 --> 01:33:39,593
Huh?

1330
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:45,307
What are you going to do now?
What's your plan?

1331
01:33:45,925 --> 01:33:49,019
I've been wondering...

1332
01:33:49,762 --> 01:33:53,148
What Min-hyuk would do
in a situation like this.

1333
01:33:54,684 --> 01:33:57,027
Min-hyuk oppa would never be
in a sitution like this!

1334
01:33:59,063 --> 01:34:04,743
Look kids, we made it out
of there safely, right?

1335
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:11,183
And besides us, nobody knows
what happened there, right?

1336
01:34:11,284 --> 01:34:14,210
So, nothing happened.
Understand?

1337
01:34:15,288 --> 01:34:19,883
My thoughts are...
because I have a plan

1338
01:34:20,418 --> 01:34:24,137
I want you two to just
forget about all this, okay?

1339
01:34:24,672 --> 01:34:26,222
Let's go home.

1340
01:34:27,258 --> 01:34:29,309
Let's go and wash up, ok?

1341
01:34:47,945 --> 01:34:50,455
What are you doing there?
Hurry down!

1342
01:35:04,003 --> 01:35:06,262
What is all this?

1343
01:35:08,383 --> 01:35:11,118
You stay put!
This is all sewer shit water.

1344
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:13,645
Our window was left open?

1345
01:35:18,184 --> 01:35:21,111
Big brother!
Help me out with this!

1346
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:30,745
Hey, Ki-woo!

1347
01:35:33,282 --> 01:35:36,251
Hey, Ki-woo, close the window!
The window!

1348
01:35:37,286 --> 01:35:39,462
Did you get electrocuted?

1349
01:35:46,087 --> 01:35:47,804
So dizzy.

1350
01:35:51,384 --> 01:35:55,437
Hold still. Keep still.

1351
01:36:00,977 --> 01:36:02,777
Shit, I feel dizzy.

1352
01:36:06,816 --> 01:36:09,367
Ki-jung, be careful!

1353
01:36:10,903 --> 01:36:12,454
Don't touch anything!

1354
01:36:25,001 --> 01:36:30,655
Honey, I must have a concussion.

1355
01:36:30,756 --> 01:36:33,600
I can't see you.

1356
01:36:54,697 --> 01:36:59,459
Honey, sister Chung-sook is

1357
01:36:59,994 --> 01:37:04,810
really a nice person.

1358
01:37:05,917 --> 01:37:09,738
But, she shoved me with her foot.

1359
01:37:11,881 --> 01:37:13,932
Repeat after me.

1360
01:37:14,467 --> 01:37:17,185
Chung-sook.

1361
01:37:18,721 --> 01:37:22,148
Chung-sook.

1362
01:37:31,067 --> 01:37:33,368
Ki-woo!

1363
01:37:34,153 --> 01:37:35,762
What at are you doing over there?

1364
01:37:35,863 --> 01:37:36,963
Huh?

1365
01:37:51,963 --> 01:37:56,099
H. E. L. P. M ...

1366
01:39:01,407 --> 01:39:02,624
Father?

1367
01:39:03,284 --> 01:39:04,584
Huh?

1368
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:09,339
What is that plan from earlier?

1369
01:39:10,916 --> 01:39:12,926
What are you talking about?

1370
01:39:13,961 --> 01:39:16,679
Earlier, you said you had a plan.

1371
01:39:17,214 --> 01:39:19,182
What are you going to do? There...

1372
01:39:19,759 --> 01:39:21,017
in the basement.

1373
01:39:22,053 --> 01:39:27,774
Ki-woo, you know
what kind of plan never fails?

1374
01:39:29,352 --> 01:39:31,878
A 'Non-Plan.' A non-plan.

1375
01:39:31,979 --> 01:39:33,655
"No plan."

1376
01:39:34,190 --> 01:39:35,740
You know why?

1377
01:39:37,777 --> 01:39:44,457
If you make a plan,
life never turns out that way.

1378
01:39:44,992 --> 01:39:46,501
Look around here.

1379
01:39:47,036 --> 01:39:52,674
You think all these people planned in droves,
"Let's spend the night in a gym"?

1380
01:39:53,209 --> 01:39:55,176
But, look now.

1381
01:39:55,336 --> 01:39:59,347
Everyone's sleeping on the
gym floor, us included.

1382
01:40:00,883 --> 01:40:04,310
That's why people
shouldn't have plans.

1383
01:40:06,347 --> 01:40:10,125
With no plan,
nothing can go wrong.

1384
01:40:10,226 --> 01:40:17,115
If you start out without a plan, even if something
spins out of control, it doesn't matter.

1385
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:21,119
Whether you kill someone
or betray your country.

1386
01:40:22,655 --> 01:40:26,290
None of it fucking matters.
Got it?

1387
01:40:27,952 --> 01:40:29,419
Father.

1388
01:40:31,455 --> 01:40:33,047
I'm sorry.

1389
01:40:33,666 --> 01:40:35,508
For what, son?

1390
01:40:38,546 --> 01:40:40,179
Everything.

1391
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,640
All of it.

1392
01:40:44,677 --> 01:40:46,978
I'll take the responsibility.

1393
01:40:47,513 --> 01:40:49,731
What are you talking about?

1394
01:40:51,767 --> 01:40:54,360
Why are you embracing
that rock like that?

1395
01:40:54,979 --> 01:40:56,696
This?

1396
01:41:02,236 --> 01:41:05,371
It keeps clinging to me.

1397
01:41:07,408 --> 01:41:11,794
You'd better get some sleep.

1398
01:41:14,832 --> 01:41:16,424
Really!

1399
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:20,553
It keeps following me.

1400
01:41:33,601 --> 01:41:35,460
Teacher Jessica?
Sorry to call on a Sunday morning.

1401
01:41:35,561 --> 01:41:37,921
Are you free for lunch today?

1402
01:41:38,022 --> 01:41:41,783
We're having an impromptu
birthday for Da-song.

1403
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,095
Are you having a birthday party?

1404
01:41:45,196 --> 01:41:48,623
If you come too,
Da-song will be so very happy.

1405
01:41:48,824 --> 01:41:52,960
And have as much pasta, gratin,
and salmon steak as you want.

1406
01:41:53,078 --> 01:41:55,188
People will be here by 1pm
so be here by then.

1407
01:41:55,289 --> 01:41:58,400
And I'll count today
as one of your sessions.

1408
01:41:58,501 --> 01:42:01,052
You know what I mean?
See you later!

1409
01:42:02,296 --> 01:42:03,738
- Mom.
- Yeah?

1410
01:42:03,839 --> 01:42:07,492
For the impromptu birthday
should we invite teacher Kevin too?

1411
01:42:07,593 --> 01:42:10,370
Great idea! Why not?
Will you contact him?

1412
01:42:10,471 --> 01:42:14,374
Get some more sleep! You need to rest.
You had a rough day yesterday.

1413
01:42:14,475 --> 01:42:18,628
If you're doing a party,
won't you need to do the rounds?

1414
01:42:18,729 --> 01:42:23,116
Right, the wine shop,
supermarket, bakery, florist...

1415
01:42:23,943 --> 01:42:26,577
I already told driver Kim to hurry over.

1416
01:42:26,695 --> 01:42:28,388
I'll pay him overtime.

1417
01:42:28,489 --> 01:42:29,589
Perfect!

1418
01:42:40,125 --> 01:42:43,803
Everyone, calm down, calm down!

1419
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:54,998
In the basement...

1420
01:42:55,099 --> 01:42:57,375
we have about 10 outdoor tables.

1421
01:42:57,476 --> 01:43:01,362
First take them all out,
then arrange them...

1422
01:43:02,022 --> 01:43:05,241
No, come to the window.
I need to show you.

1423
01:43:06,944 --> 01:43:08,720
With Da-song's tent in the middle

1424
01:43:08,821 --> 01:43:12,356
Set the tables outward in a curve...

1425
01:43:12,457 --> 01:43:14,601
A crane-wing formation!

1426
01:43:14,702 --> 01:43:17,987
Like Admiral Yi used. You remember
Battle of The Hansan Island?

1427
01:43:18,088 --> 01:43:20,648
Think of the tent as the
Japanese warship.

1428
01:43:20,749 --> 01:43:26,029
And our tables in the crane-wing formation
in a semi-circular fashion.

1429
01:43:26,130 --> 01:43:30,325
Then near the tent will be the
barbeque grill, firewood and such

1430
01:43:30,426 --> 01:43:32,627
all nicely arranged.

1431
01:43:32,728 --> 01:43:36,589
That will be great!
Bring your husband too!

1432
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:37,415
Yeah!

1433
01:43:37,516 --> 01:43:41,485
And definitely no presents,
just come!

1434
01:43:42,354 --> 01:43:44,047
Dress code?

1435
01:43:44,148 --> 01:43:47,783
It's just an impromptu.
You can wear sweat pants if you want!

1436
01:43:48,819 --> 01:43:54,582
And absolutely no presents
Just come and enjoy the food.

1437
01:43:55,618 --> 01:43:57,727
You know already
my culinary skills.

1438
01:43:57,828 --> 01:44:02,965
Right! Right!
We'll drink wine in daylight.

1439
01:44:04,543 --> 01:44:08,054
If you would sing a song,
that'd be grand ! You know the one...

1440
01:44:24,104 --> 01:44:26,906
Ajumma, shhh!
He's still sleeping!

1441
01:44:27,441 --> 01:44:30,510
Today the sky's so blue,
and no yellow-dust pollution!

1442
01:44:30,611 --> 01:44:32,787
Thanks to all the rain yesterday.

1443
01:44:33,822 --> 01:44:35,056
Right.

1444
01:44:35,157 --> 01:44:39,252
So we traded camping
for a garden party. Deal!

1445
01:44:40,287 --> 01:44:42,088
It's lemons into lemonade.

1446
01:44:45,209 --> 01:44:50,263
Right, what would we have done
if not for the rain!

1447
01:44:51,799 --> 01:44:56,310
And definitely no presents.
I mean it!

1448
01:44:56,845 --> 01:45:00,731
Right, you've got the Mini Cooper so,
we'll just squeeze it into our garage.

1449
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Go on up!

1450
01:45:02,101 --> 01:45:07,013
Back it in tight.
Just don't block the Benz.

1451
01:45:07,114 --> 01:45:10,214
You're here!
It's been so long!

1452
01:45:13,237 --> 01:45:15,579
I told you no presents!

1453
01:45:33,632 --> 01:45:35,766
Oppa, you were thinking
of something else.

1454
01:45:35,926 --> 01:45:37,310
What?

1455
01:45:38,345 --> 01:45:41,522
While we were kissing, you were
thinking of something else.

1456
01:45:43,642 --> 01:45:44,900
No.

1457
01:45:45,936 --> 01:45:49,572
What do you mean, no?
You're still doing it.

1458
01:45:52,109 --> 01:45:53,367
Wow.

1459
01:45:54,987 --> 01:45:57,705
Everyone looks great, right?

1460
01:45:59,116 --> 01:46:02,877
Even for an impromptu,
they all look so cool

1461
01:46:03,746 --> 01:46:06,130
and so natural.

1462
01:46:08,167 --> 01:46:09,425
Da-hye.

1463
01:46:12,004 --> 01:46:13,637
Do I fit in well?

1464
01:46:15,015 --> 01:46:16,741
What?

1465
01:46:17,676 --> 01:46:20,686
Do I fit in well here?

1466
01:46:30,606 --> 01:46:32,823
Why? Where are you going?

1467
01:46:33,358 --> 01:46:34,575
I need to go down.

1468
01:46:35,110 --> 01:46:37,119
Just hang out with me.

1469
01:46:38,113 --> 01:46:40,039
I need to go below.

1470
01:46:40,449 --> 01:46:45,461
With all those boring people?
Can't you just hangout with me?

1471
01:46:46,455 --> 01:46:50,733
Not to those people.
Down lower.

1472
01:46:50,834 --> 01:46:53,761
Wow, what is that?

1473
01:46:56,799 --> 01:47:00,684
Really, I can't believe
we're doing this at our age.

1474
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:03,187
It's embarrassing.

1475
01:47:04,223 --> 01:47:05,665
I'm really sorry, driver Kim.

1476
01:47:05,766 --> 01:47:08,960
It's at my wife's insistence.
I can't do anything about it.

1477
01:47:09,061 --> 01:47:10,628
But the concept is simple.

1478
01:47:10,729 --> 01:47:16,050
Teacher Jessica will carry out
the birthday cake in a little parade.

1479
01:47:16,151 --> 01:47:20,138
Then, we jump out
and attack teacher Jessica

1480
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:22,473
swinging our Indian tomahawks!

1481
01:47:22,574 --> 01:47:23,349
Ah, right.

1482
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:28,879
Just then, Da-song the good Indian
will jump out and we'll do battle.

1483
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:33,609
Ultimately, he'll save the cake goddess Jessica,
and they will all give a big cheer.

1484
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:35,302
Something like that.

1485
01:47:36,447 --> 01:47:37,447
Silly, isn't it?

1486
01:47:37,548 --> 01:47:42,368
I guess your wife likes
events and surprises.

1487
01:47:42,469 --> 01:47:44,562
Yeah, she does.

1488
01:47:44,721 --> 01:47:47,690
But she's particularly into this party.

1489
01:47:49,226 --> 01:47:52,194
You're trying your best, too.

1490
01:47:53,230 --> 01:47:56,198
Well, because
you love her, after all.

1491
01:48:01,738 --> 01:48:02,838
Driver Kim.

1492
01:48:04,491 --> 01:48:07,126
You know today is your work day.

1493
01:48:12,291 --> 01:48:16,635
Think of this as an
extension of your work, okay?

1494
01:48:27,931 --> 01:48:29,582
Have you been down there?

1495
01:48:29,683 --> 01:48:33,419
- No, not yet.
- Shouldn't we have a talk with them?

1496
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:35,338
In a way that is
good for everyone?

1497
01:48:35,439 --> 01:48:36,380
Exactly!

1498
01:48:36,481 --> 01:48:39,258
We all got too fucking
worked up last night!

1499
01:48:39,359 --> 01:48:43,287
I know! And, dad was going on
about some plan...

1500
01:48:43,697 --> 01:48:46,140
- No, I'm going down there now.
- Hold on!

1501
01:48:46,241 --> 01:48:48,434
Take this down to them.

1502
01:48:48,535 --> 01:48:50,144
- They must be hungry.
- Right.

1503
01:48:50,245 --> 01:48:52,213
Let them eat first.

1504
01:48:54,124 --> 01:48:55,758
Come next time for sure!

1505
01:48:56,793 --> 01:48:58,528
Here you are, Jessica.

1506
01:48:58,629 --> 01:49:00,988
- This is too good !
- Yes, to die for!

1507
01:49:01,089 --> 01:49:03,574
I've got a special favor to ask.

1508
01:49:03,675 --> 01:49:04,850
What kind?

1509
01:49:05,093 --> 01:49:07,161
This is...
how to describe it?

1510
01:49:07,262 --> 01:49:09,205
Da-song's trauma
recovery cake?

1511
01:49:09,306 --> 01:49:12,775
So, it needs to be you who does this.
Today's highlight!

1512
01:50:35,726 --> 01:50:39,111
Excuse me...
Are you ok?

1513
01:50:44,151 --> 01:50:45,659
Excuse me...

1514
01:50:55,704 --> 01:50:57,004
Mister! Mister!

1515
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:47,030
Oppa? Oppa?

1516
01:52:53,572 --> 01:52:56,307
Da-song !
Happy birthday!

1517
01:52:56,408 --> 01:52:57,875
Congratulations!

1518
01:53:05,128 --> 01:53:06,554
Oh, fuck!

1519
01:53:16,229 --> 01:53:18,329
Stop!!

1520
01:53:18,430 --> 01:53:20,539
Sister Chung-sook!

1521
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,415
Ki-jung!

1522
01:53:21,516 --> 01:53:23,125
Come on out, Chung-sook!

1523
01:53:23,226 --> 01:53:26,636
Stop the bleeding!
Push down on the wound!

1524
01:53:31,098 --> 01:53:32,533
Da-song!

1525
01:53:33,189 --> 01:53:34,408
Honey!

1526
01:53:35,590 --> 01:53:37,315
Let go!
Don't do it!

1527
01:53:48,666 --> 01:53:50,429
It hurts!

1528
01:53:54,927 --> 01:53:56,117
The ER!

1529
01:53:56,218 --> 01:53:57,751
Get the car out!
The car!

1530
01:53:57,852 --> 01:53:59,395
Driver Kim !
What the fuck are you doing?!

1531
01:53:59,496 --> 01:54:01,622
If we wait for the ambulance,
it'll be too late!

1532
01:54:01,723 --> 01:54:04,133
Dad, dad!
Stop pressing it.

1533
01:54:04,234 --> 01:54:07,194
Pressing it makes it
hurt more.

1534
01:54:07,854 --> 01:54:09,004
Give me the car key!
The car key!

1535
01:54:09,105 --> 01:54:11,922
Throw them !
Just throw me the key!

1536
01:54:29,542 --> 01:54:31,118
You okay?

1537
01:54:31,219 --> 01:54:33,220
Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!

1538
01:54:35,291 --> 01:54:37,808
How do you do, Mr. Park?

1539
01:54:37,926 --> 01:54:38,993
You know me?

1540
01:54:39,094 --> 01:54:40,769
Respect!

1541
01:56:07,432 --> 01:56:10,793
A month later when I opened my eyes,
the first face that I saw...

1542
01:56:10,894 --> 01:56:12,694
was that of a detective.

1543
01:56:12,854 --> 01:56:17,633
You have the right to an attorney...

1544
01:56:17,734 --> 01:56:20,035
He looked nothing
like a detective.

1545
01:56:24,574 --> 01:56:26,267
Is he laughing?

1546
01:56:26,368 --> 01:56:28,043
Just a moment.

1547
01:56:28,453 --> 01:56:33,298
Then, the doctor who looked
nothing like a doctor spoke.

1548
01:56:34,334 --> 01:56:38,112
That happens sometimes
immediately after brain surgery.

1549
01:56:38,213 --> 01:56:40,430
They keep laughing
for no reason.

1550
01:56:41,091 --> 01:56:43,308
Can you hear me?

1551
01:56:43,551 --> 01:56:45,435
Can you hear me, now?

1552
01:56:45,553 --> 01:56:47,329
Then, we have to do it again?

1553
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:48,247
Do what again?

1554
01:56:48,348 --> 01:56:49,898
What I just did.
The Miranda.

1555
01:56:52,435 --> 01:56:56,255
You ! Um... have the right!
To remain silent!

1556
01:56:56,356 --> 01:56:59,091
Anything you say can and will
be used against you ...right? ...and

1557
01:56:59,192 --> 01:57:01,576
He keeps laughing, look!

1558
01:57:04,614 --> 01:57:10,711
Even when I heard how much
Ki-jung bled that day

1559
01:57:12,872 --> 01:57:20,087
even when I heard the words "document forgery,"
"trespassing," "foul play, but self-defense"

1560
01:57:20,338 --> 01:57:24,725
...and that we were lucky to get away
with just a probation...

1561
01:57:27,762 --> 01:57:30,789
even when I finally got to
see Ki-jung's face...

1562
01:57:30,890 --> 01:57:33,900
Kim Ki-jung
Nov 20, 1996 -- July 1,2018

1563
01:57:35,437 --> 01:57:37,738
I kept laughing.

1564
01:57:47,407 --> 01:57:52,895
But, when I looked back
and watched all the news reports

1565
01:57:52,996 --> 01:57:54,188
I didn't laugh much at all.

1566
01:58:46,549 --> 01:58:53,514
Mom and I actually had no idea
where father was.

1567
01:58:55,850 --> 01:59:01,530
But, those detectives trying to tail us
still wore themselves out.

1568
01:59:05,568 --> 01:59:11,540
Eventually, when the news went quiet, and
the taills became less frequent

1569
01:59:12,075 --> 01:59:15,502
I started, from time to time,
to go up that mountain.

1570
01:59:17,539 --> 01:59:22,259
From up there, you get
a good view of the house.

1571
01:59:25,004 --> 01:59:32,135
That day, despite the cold,
I felt the urge to stay behind longer.

1572
01:59:45,483 --> 01:59:48,994
Dash - dash - dot - dot

1573
01:59:53,023 --> 01:59:56,491
dot - dot - dot - dash
dash - dash - dot...

1574
02:00:17,536 --> 02:00:18,878
Son!

1575
02:00:20,852 --> 02:00:24,696
You may be able to read this letter.

1576
02:00:28,234 --> 02:00:34,539
You were a Boy Scout, so just in case,
I am writing you a letter this way.

1577
02:00:37,577 --> 02:00:40,545
Have you recovered ok
from your injuries?

1578
02:00:41,581 --> 02:00:45,884
I'm sure your mom is
plenty healthy.

1579
02:00:49,922 --> 02:00:52,724
I'm doing fine
down here.

1580
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:56,519
Though, I often cry
thinking bout Ki-jung.

1581
02:00:59,557 --> 02:01:04,402
Even now, what happened
that day seems surreal.

1582
02:01:05,647 --> 02:01:07,364
Feels like I dreamt it all.

1583
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:10,867
Maybe I didn't.

1584
02:01:11,903 --> 02:01:16,873
That day, as I ran out the gate,
I suddenly realized

1585
02:01:17,909 --> 02:01:19,668
where I needed to go.

1586
02:01:59,075 --> 02:02:02,060
A house where such
grisly crime took place

1587
02:02:02,161 --> 02:02:05,422
is surely not so easy to sell.

1588
02:02:08,543 --> 02:02:10,944
I'm so sorry, Mr. Park.

1589
02:02:11,045 --> 02:02:17,600
So, I struggled to hold out in the
empty house until the new owners arrived.

1590
02:02:20,138 --> 02:02:23,040
Still, thanks to the
house being empty

1591
02:02:23,141 --> 02:02:28,003
What was her name?
'Moon' and 'Gwang?'

1592
02:02:28,104 --> 02:02:32,407
I was able to give lady Moon-gwang
a proper, dignified send off.

1593
02:02:33,526 --> 02:02:40,290
I gave her a tree-side burial which I hear are very
trendy these days. So, hell, I did my best.

1594
02:02:43,828 --> 02:02:47,464
But, those real estate sharks
sure are clever.

1595
02:02:52,003 --> 02:02:56,239
They hoodwinked some people
newly arrived in Korea and knowing nothing

1596
02:02:56,340 --> 02:02:58,683
and ultimately managed to
sell them the house.

1597
02:02:59,802 --> 02:03:03,080
With the parents working in a foreign company
and the kids attending a foreign school,

1598
02:03:03,181 --> 02:03:05,774
the family is usually out.

1599
02:03:05,892 --> 02:03:11,321
But, the goddamned housekeeper
stays glued here 24 hours a day.

1600
02:03:11,481 --> 02:03:16,409
Each time I go upstairs to the kitchen,
I put my life on the line.

1601
02:03:18,946 --> 02:03:23,291
It turns out that Germans don't eat and
drink just sausages and beer.

1602
02:03:23,826 --> 02:03:25,877
What a relief.

1603
02:03:28,456 --> 02:03:32,842
Passing the time down here,
everything starts to go hazy.

1604
02:03:37,381 --> 02:03:41,559
Today, at least, I was able to
write you a letter.

1605
02:03:43,095 --> 02:03:46,998
If I send out the letter
this way every night

1606
02:03:47,099 --> 02:03:51,569
maybe someday
you'll see it.

1607
02:03:57,610 --> 02:03:59,661
So long for now.

1608
02:04:13,209 --> 02:04:14,276
Ki-woo?
Is that you?

1609
02:04:14,377 --> 02:04:15,477
Yes.

1610
02:04:29,892 --> 02:04:34,904
Father,
I made a plan today.

1611
02:04:36,440 --> 02:04:38,366
It's a master plan.

1612
02:04:41,404 --> 02:04:43,079
I'm going to make money.

1613
02:04:43,656 --> 02:04:45,456
...loads of it.

1614
02:04:48,995 --> 02:04:53,506
University, career, marriage,
they're all fine

1615
02:04:53,666 --> 02:04:55,692
but I will first make money.

1616
02:04:55,793 --> 02:05:01,139
You'll see once you go in,
but it's very spacious.

1617
02:05:01,674 --> 02:05:06,411
Actually, we don't show
this kind of house to just anyone.

1618
02:05:06,512 --> 02:05:11,024
When I make the money,
I will first buy this house.

1619
02:05:12,059 --> 02:05:16,321
On the day we move in,
Mom and I will be in the garden.

1620
02:05:16,856 --> 02:05:19,282
Because the sunshine
is so nice there.

1621
02:05:20,443 --> 02:05:22,493
All you have to do

1622
02:05:22,653 --> 02:05:25,538
is come up the stairs.

1623
02:06:48,155 --> 02:06:52,292
Until that day comes, please
take very good care of yourself.

1624
02:06:56,956 --> 02:06:59,090
So long for now.
